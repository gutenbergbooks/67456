<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY AGNES PIERSOL.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the dead hour of the night. The room was
a high wainscotted apartment, with furniture of a
rich but antique pattern. The pale moonlight streaming
through the curtained window, and struggling
with the subdued light of a candle placed in a corner,
disclosed the figure of a sick man extended on a bed,
wrapped in an unquiet slumber. By his side sat a
care-worn though still beautiful woman gazing
anxiously on his face, and breathlessly awaiting the
crisis of the fever—for it was now the ninth day since
that strong man had been prostrated by the hand of
disease, and during all that time he had raved in an
incessant delirium. He had at length dropped into
an unquiet slumber, broken at first by starts and
moans, but during the last hour he had been less restless,
and he now lay as still as a sculptured statue.
His wife well knew that ere morning the crisis would
be past, and she waited, with all a woman’s affection,
breathlessly for the event. Aye! though few women
have been wronged as Emily Walpole had been
wronged, she still cherished her husband’s image,
for he was, despite his errors, the lover of her youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few girls had been more admired than Emily
Severn. But it was not only the beauty of her features
and the elegance of her form which drew around
her a train of worshippers: her mind was one of no
ordinary cast, and the sweetness of her temper lent
an ineffable charm to all she did. No one was so
eagerly sought for at a ball or a pic-nic as Emily
Severn, and at her parental fireside she was the universal
favorite. It was long before she loved. She
was not to be misled by glitter or show. She could
only bestow her affections where she thought they
were deserved, and it was not until she met Edward
Walpole that she learned to surrender her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Walpole, when he became the husband
of Emily Severn, was apparently all that a woman
could wish. He was warm hearted, of a noble soul,
kind, gentle, and ever ready to waive his own selfish
gratification at the call of duty. But, alas! he had
one weakness, <span class='it'>he did not act from principle</span>. His
generous deeds were the offspring of a warm heart
rather than of a regulated intellect. As yet he had
never been placed in circumstances which severely
tried his principles. But, about a year after his marriage,
he fell heir to the large property of a maiden
aunt, and at once his whole style of life was altered.
His accession of wealth brought him into contact
with society in which hitherto he had never mingled,
where the polish of factitious politeness often hides
the most depraved morals. Above all, by abandoning
his profession, he condemned himself to comparative
idleness. He now began to be tortured by
<span class='it'>ennui</span>, and sought any excitement to pass away the
time. The harpies who infest society, and with the
appearance of gentlemen have the hearts of fiends,
now marked him for their prey; and his open and
generous nature made him their victim in a comparatively
short space of time. We shall not trace his
downward progress. It is always a melancholy task
to mark the lapse from virtue of a noble and generous
character, and how much more so when the heart
of a wife is to be broken by the dereliction from rectitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emily saw the gradual aberration of her husband,
and though she mourned the cause, no word of reproach
escaped her lips, but by every gentle means
she strove to bring back her husband to the paths of
virtue. But a fatality seemed to have seized him.
He was in a whirlpool from which he could not extricate
himself. He still loved his wife, and more
than once, when her looks cut him to the heart, he
made an effort to break loose from his associates;
but they always found means to bring him back ere
long. Thus a year passed. His fortune began to
give way, for he had learnt to gamble. As his losses
became more frequent his thirst for cards became
greater, until at length he grew sullen and desperate
He was now a changed man. He no longer felt
compunction at the wrongs he inflicted on his sweet
wife, but if her sad looks touched his heart at all they
only stung him into undeserved reproaches. He
was become harsh and violent. Yet his poor wife
endured all in silence. No recrimination passed her
lips. But in the solitude of her chamber she shed
many a bitter tear, and often, at the hour of midnight,
when her husband was far away in some riotous
company, her prayers were heard ascending for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two years had now elapsed, and the last one had
been a year of bitter sorrow to Emily. At length her
husband came home one night an almost ruined man.
He had been stripped at the gambling table, of every
cent of his property, over which he had any control,
and he was now in a state almost approaching to
madness. Before morning he was in a high fever.
For days he raved incessantly of his ruin, cursing
the wretches by whom he had been plundered. Nine
days had passed and now the crisis was at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock struck twelve. As sound after sound
rung out on the stillness and died away in echoes,
reverberating through the house, the sick man moved
in his sleep, until, when the last stroke was given,
he opened his eyes and looked languidly and vacantly
around. His gaze almost instantly met the face of
his wife. For a moment his recollection could be
seen struggling in his countenance, and at length an
expression of deep mental suffering settled in his
face. His wife had by this time risen and was now
at his bedside. She saw that the crisis was past, and
as she laid her hand in his, and felt the moisture of
the skin, she knew that he would recover. Tears of
joy gushed from her eyes and dropped on the sick
man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavenly father, I thank thee!” she murmured
at length, when her emotion suffered her to speak,
while the tears streamed faster and faster down
her cheek, “he is safe. He will recover,” and though
she ceased speaking, her lips still moved in silent
prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sick man felt the tears on his face, he saw his
wife’s grateful emotion, he knew that she was even
now praying for him, and as he recalled to mind the
wrongs which he had inflicted on that uncomplaining
woman, his heart was melted within him. There is
no chastener like sickness; the most stony bosom
softens beneath it. He thought of the long days and
nights during which he must have been ill, and when
his insulted and abused wife had watched anxiously
at his bedside. Oh! how he had crushed that noble
heart; and now this was her return! She prayed
for him who had wronged her. She shed tears of joy
because her erring husband had been restored, as it
were, to life. These things rushed through his
bosom and the strong man’s eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emily—dear Emily,” he said, “I have been a
villain, and can you forgive me? I deserve it not
at your hands—but can you, will you forgive a wretch
like me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! <span class='it'>can</span> I forgive you?” sobbed the grateful
wife, “yes! yes! but too gladly. But it is not
against me you have sinned, it is against a good and
righteous God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it—I know it,” said the repentant husband,
“and to His mercy I look. I cannot pray for
myself, but oh! Emily pray for me. He has saved
me from the jaws of death. Pray for me, dear
Emily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife knelt at the bedside, and while the husband,
exhausted by his agitation, sank back with
closed eyes on the pillow, she read the noble petition
for the sick, from the book of Common Prayer. At
times the sobs of Emily would almost choke her utterance,
but the holy words she read had at length,
a soothing effect both on her mind and that of her
husband. When the prayer was over, she remained
for several minutes kneeling, while her husband
murmured at intervals his heart-felt responses. At
length she rose from the bedside. Her husband
would again have spoken, to beseech once more
her forgiveness. But with a glad feeling at her heart—a
feeling such as she had not had for years—she
enjoined silence on him, and sat down again by his
bedside to watch. At length he fell again into a
calm slumber, while the now happy wife watched
at his bedside until morning, breathing thanksgivings
for her husband’s recovery, and shedding tears of joy
the while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sick man awoke at daybreak, he was a
changed being. He was now convalescent, he was
more, he was a repentant man. He wept on the
bosom of his wife, and made resolutions of reformation
which, after his recovery, through the blessing
of God, he was enabled to fulfil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fortune of Walpole was mostly gone, but sufficient
remained from its wrecks, to allow him the
comforts, though not the luxuries of life. He soon
settled his affairs and removed from his splendid
mansion to a quiet cottage in a neighboring village.
The only pang he felt was at leaving the home which
for so many years had been the dwelling of the
head of his family—the home where his uncle had
died, and which had been lost only through his own
folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Walpole nor his wife ever regretted their
loss of fortune; for both looked upon it as the means
used by an over-ruling Providence to bring the husband
back to the path of rectitude; and they referred
to it therefore with feelings rather of gratitude
than of repining. In their quiet cottage, on the
wreck of their wealth, they enjoyed a happiness to
which they had been strangers in the days of their
opulence. A family of lovely children sprung up
around them, and it was the daily task of the parents
to educate these young minds in the path of duty
and rectitude. Oh! the happy hours which they enjoyed
in that white, vine-embowered cottage, with
their children smiling around them, and the consciousness
of a well regulated life, filling their hearts
with peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years rolled by and the hair of Walpole began to
turn gray, while the brow of his sweet wife showed
more than one wrinkle, but still their happiness remained
undiminished.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A NEW SCHOOL OF POETRY AT HAND.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall never forget our emotions when we inhaled,
for the first time after a lingering illness, the
fresh breezes of a September morning. Oh! the
visions of dewy meadows, rustling forest trees, and
silvery brooks which the delicious air called up before
us. This little book has awakened much the
same emotions in our bosom. It reminds us of the
breezy lawns where we played when a child; of the
old mossy forest trees beneath which we loved to sit
and muse; of the silent, stately Brandywine that
glided along at our feet, its clear waters sliding over
the rocks or rippling against the long willow leaves
that trembled in its current. There is a freshness
about Lowell’s Poems which bewitches our fancy.
They display a genius that has startled us. They
breathe a healthy, honest, good old Saxon spirit, that
opens our heart to them as by a sign of brotherhood.
We feel that he is kin of our kin and blood of our
blood, and we take his book to our bosom without
suffering it to plead the exquisite petition which he
has put into its mouth, for “charity in Christ’s dear
name.” Lowell is a man after our own heart. We
have a word or two to say of him in connection with
the poetry of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one must have perceived that a new school
of poetry is at hand. No one who has thought on
the subject can have failed to see that the fever for
Byron, like all fevers, is both wearing itself out and
exhausting the patient. With the death of the noble
lord began the decline of the school to which he gave
such popularity, and though he has had many imitators
since, the phrenzy respecting his poetry is nearly
over. We do not mean to depreciate Byron. Every
great poet should be spoken of with reverence; for
they all alike discourse in the language of the gods;
and Byron was not only a great poet, but the greatest
poet of his school. That school, however, was a
bad one—the fierce, unholy offspring of an incestuous
age. It was a school in which the restlessness of
passion seems to have forced its votaries into poetry.
They had none of the calm, enduring enthusiasm of
the great poets of the past; they did not speak with
the majesty of Jove, but with the fury of a Delphin
priestess. They were essentially the poets of a
crowd, expressing the emotions of men in a state
of high excitement, and consequently whirling
away their hearers with them in a phrenzy for the
time unconquerable, but destined to subside with the
first calm in the public mind. But the truly great
poets—Milton, Shakspeare and Spencer—sit far
away on a mountain by themselves, singing in calm
enthusiasm to the stars of heaven, and startling the
dweller on the plain as well as the shepherd on the
hill-side with a melody that seems a part of heaven.
The school of Byron is that of a generation; the
school of the old masters is that of eternity. The
one is a lurid planet, that blazes fitfully amid storm
and darkness; the others are fixed stars, that shine
around Milton, the greatest of all, in undimmed and
undying lustre.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Ὡς δ’ οτ’ εν ουρανω αστρα φαεινην αμφι σεληνην
Φαινετ’ αριπρεπεα.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have said that a new school of poetry is at
hand, and the remark may, at first sight, appear extravagant
when we consider the stagnation which
has been exhibited for years. But betwixt the decline
of one school and the rise of another, there is
always a pause. When Milton wrote, a lustrum had
elapsed since Shakspeare died. After the decay of
Pope, a half a century of barrenness ensued before
Cowper brought in a more masculine verse. The
poetic soil, during these interregnums, seems to be
worn out, and to require to lie fallow until it can recruit
its energies. Only a few sparse flowers bloom
upon the waste. But these, although insignificant in
themselves, serve to betray the changes in the soil.
They are premonitory of the coming harvest. They
give us a clue to the character of the approaching
school, and although often vague and contradictory,
they afford us hints for which we would in vain seek
elsewhere. We do not say that, from such hints,
the nature of a school can be certainly predicted.
The public taste, to use a phrase from the geologists,
is in a transition state, and what the result may be,
will, in a measure, puzzle the acutest mind. But we
can still approximate to the truth. And even now
we may hazard a conjecture respecting the characteristics
of the school which will supersede that of
Byron. It will resemble, in many particulars, that
of the old poets. It will have the same calm, enduring
enthusiasm. It will be marked by a like earnestness
of purpose, by the same comprehensive
love for “suffering, sad humanity.” It will have
none of the jaundiced views of Byron, and little of
the <span class='it'>petit maître</span> style of Pope. It will be intellectual,
and, we fear, pedantic also. It threatens to be disgraced
by conceits. Circumstances, it is true, may
occur to give a different turn to the character of the
new school, or a <span class='sc'>Messiah</span> may arise to do away by
a single dispensation with all former types; but, so
far as we can foresee now, the Tennysons, Longfellows,
and poets of that cast of mind, will give the
tone to the coming change in the public taste. Indeed
they are already bringing about a revolution.
Men are first acted on singly and then in masses, and
the masses have even now begun to feel the influence
of Longfellow and Tennyson. Wordsworth,
too, is not to be disregarded in this revolution, but
his influence, though powerful so far as it goes, will
never be general. He is the poet of the few, not of
the many. He is the priest of the metaphysicians,
the seer of the refiners of fine gold. He writes
poems, but his followers write twaddle. He cannot
found a school. He cannot do this aside from his
peculiarities. We will explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a common error to attribute the formation of
a school of poetry to the influence of some one great
mind, and we are pointed to Byron, Pope, Shakspeare
and others, as instances to prove this creed.
The theory is false and illegitimate, the offspring of
shallow minds and conceited pedants. A popular
poet, we grant, may have many imitators of his <span class='it'>verbal</span>
style; but the spirit of his school, like the prophet’s
inspiration, dies with him. If we look to the
poets of our own language we shall find that the
great masters usually followed rather than preceded
their respective schools; and if we look abroad we
shall, with few exceptions, discover the same fact.
The school of Byron, for instance, was born of the
atheism, scorn and fury of the French Revolution, and
we can see foreshadowings of the spirit of Childe Harold
in most of the minor poems of that day. Byron carried
the school up to its culminating point, and since
his death, if not before, it has been on the decline.
Pope was the last of a school that had its origin as
far back as the exile of Charles the Second, and the
French style and sickly effeminacy of this most finished
of our poets began to decline while Walpole
still sat at the Treasury, when Lady Mary played
the wit at Richmond, while clouded canes and full-bottomed
wigs yet figured in the Mall. Milton belonged
to no school but his own; he stands alone in
unapproachable glory; but his genius was deeply
influenced by the commotions of the civil wars.
Shakspeare had few followers, but many predecessors,
and as he was the last so he was the
greatest of his school; while Spencer, standing as
he did above the grave of chivalry and allegorical
romance, only gave vent, in his immortal poem, to
a requiem for the departed great. All these men
embodied the characteristics of their age, and left
them as a heritage to posterity. They were types of
their times: they spoke the universal mind of their
cotemporaries. It is the cant of the day to talk of
men as being in advance of their age; but there
never was and never will be such a man. Even
Bacon, the giant of the modern world, and the reputed
author of the inductive philosophy, was only
its great high-priest; for even before he had written
his advancement of learning, twenty minds, in every
quarter of Europe, were stumbling on the same
truths. We are not waiting, therefore, for the advent
of a seer to found a new poetic school, for the
school must come first, and then we may expect the
seer. It will require a dozen Tennysons to make a
Spencer. The days of the years of the sons of the
prophets are not yet numbered—when they shall be,
a new Messiah will appear in our midst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tendency of the age to a new school in poetry
is strikingly evinced by the genius of Lowell. He
was educated in the school of the older poets until
his whole soul has become imbued with their spirit.
Of these writers Spencer is clearly his favorite. The
allusions to this fine old poet are frequent in his
poems, and we often meet with expressions and turns
of thought, reminding us strikingly of the Faery
Queen. We do not mean to charge Lowell with
plagiarism: far from it. But he has read Spencer so
thoroughly that he is often guilty of unconscious imitation.
His fondness for this enchanting writer, is
indeed the greatest peril which threatens his poetical
career. There is such a thing as being beguiled by
a syren until you become her slave. We tell him to
beware. Let our young countryman shake himself
loose from his bewitching fetters, and be, as he is
partially and can be wholly, original. Let him be
his own master. <span class='it'>Aut Cæsar, aut nihil.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This language, when applied to some, would be a
satire. But Lowell has evinced the possession of
powers, nearly, if not altogether equal to those of
any cotemporary poet; and when, in connexion with
this, we consider his youth, we feel justified in assigning
to him a genius of the first rank. Let us not
be misunderstood. We do not say that Lowell has
written better poems than any American, but only
that he has evinced a capacity, which in time, may
enable him to do so. Indeed this volume of poems,
although possessing high merit, is rather a proof
of what he may do than of what he has done. There
is scarcely a poem in the book which a critic might
not prove to be full of faults; but then there would
be passages scattered through it which, to an honest
man, would redeem the whole. And since the publication
of this volume, Lowell has written other
poems evincing a progressive excellence and establishing
his genius beyond cavil. In one faculty he is
certainly equal to any cotemporary, and that faculty
is the highest one a poet can possess—we mean
<span style='font-size:smaller'>IDEALITY</span>. The imagination of Lowell is of the loftiest
character. No one can read a ballad published in
this Magazine for October, 1841, or a poem entitled
“Rosaline,” published for February, 1842, without
awarding to our young countryman the gift of this
enviable faculty. Whether he is capable of conceiving
and executing an extended poem remains to
be seen; and we would not advise him to attempt
the task until time has matured his taste and refined
his powers. But if the Lycidas of Milton, or the
Venus and Adonis of Shakspeare were any evidence
of the intellect of these two masters, then are some
of the poems of Lowell evidence that he has the
power, which if properly cultivated, will enable him
to write a great poem. The young eagle that flutters
its wings on the mountain top may not yet be
able to breast the tempest, yet it is an eagle still, and
he must be deaf indeed who cannot distinguish its
cry. We say that Lowell has an ideality of the
loftiest order, and that no one can read his poems
without discovering this. We say that ideality is the
highest quality of a poet’s mind. So far forth, therefore,
Lowell is entitled to rank among the foremost
of our poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this is not all. A poet may have the intellect
of a god, and yet want the heart to make him truly
great; for all true greatness is based on nobility of
mind, without which mere intellect is but a tinkling
cymbal. All the great old poets eminently possessed
this quality. Their hearts kept time, in a majestic
march, to noble sentiments. They loved their race,
and in their writings showed they were in earnest.
This love for his fellows is one of the finest characteristics
of Lowell, and contrasts strikingly with the
frippery of Pope, and the sneering misanthropy of
Byron. We adore this feeling. It is the good old
Saxon spirit, the sentiment of universal brotherhood.
We are all the children of one father, fitted for sympathy,
companionship, affection. We are not born
to scorn our fellows. We have not been created to
seclude ourselves from society, to dwell in caves, and
cells, and lonely hermitages. We are made for
nobler purposes. Our mission, like that of him of
Nazareth, is to go about doing good. Nor let any
man hate his fellows, thinking them regardless of
his sorrows. The most unfortunate of us are not
without friends, often loving us unknown and in spite
of our faults. We have seen the criminal at the bar,
when all others shrunk from him, cheered by the
affection of the very wife or mother he had wronged;
and even the houseless old beggar by the way-side
finds a friend in every honest heart that sees his grey
hairs tossing in the wind. All over this wide world,
in hut, or cottage, or lordly hall, millions of hearts
are beating with love towards each other, so that
the whole human race is, as it were, interwoven
together by innumerable fine threads of sympathy
and affection. A word, a deed, or a kind look may
make us a friend of whom we little think: and it may
be that even now, some one whom we have never
seen, is yearning towards us, because something
that we may have written has found an echo in his
bosom. God be thanked for this, the brightest gift
in a poet’s mission! How many hearts have sympathised
with the blind old Milton, and how many
more will sympathise with him to the end of all
time. And thus it is with the good of every age.
They live again in the memory of posterity. The
dying words of Algernon Sidney will thrill the freeman’s
heart through untold centuries. The apostolic
charity of Fenelon, Latimer, Bunyan, Augustine, and
of all holy men, will endear them to noble hearts as
long as time endures. The only immortality worth
having is an immortality like this; and it matters not
whether our names are known to those who bless us
or not. Men have written noble sentiments and
died and been forgotten, yet posterity has still yearned
towards the poet when it read his lines. What
comfort may not an author thus bring upon his fellows!
Go out into the country and enter that lowly cottage,—you
will find perhaps some mother weeping over
little Nell, and drawing consolation from traits in the
character which remind her of a darling child now
in heaven. Thus by ten thousand links does an
author bind himself to the hearts of his fellows, until
at length he comes to be loved as we would love a
brother. And often the precepts he instils awaken
the dormant good in other hearts. Lowell has finely
expressed this in one of his earliest poems⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lowell has a passion, if we may use the word, for
images of quiet beauty. He seems to worship nature;
he is evidently a dreamer. We venture to predict
that he has spent many a day loitering through the
summer woods, or lingering by the side of some
silvery stream. He is a close observer—as what
genius is not? There is a freshness about his writings
which convinces you that he has not drawn his
notions of the country, like many even of our rural
poets, from books. He writes freely and therefore
gracefully. His images of nature come to us with a
delicious freshness, reminding us of forest nooks,
sylvan retreats, and the fragrance of new mown
hay. He seems to be peculiarly fond of water, and
of the music which its dropping or its flow occasions,

<p class='pindent'>Many of the poems in this volume as well as several
pieces since given to the world, are love-poems,
and breathe all the delicacy and exquisite tenderness
of a first affection. Lowell’s conception of the female
character is noble, chivalrous, pure and elevating.
No poet in our language has a loftier idea of a true
woman. Mere personal beauty does not appear to
awaken his adoration, but every feeling of his soul
kindles at a sweet voice or a lovely mind. We like
him for this. A sweet voice is a talisman, and we
question whether any true poet could love a woman
whose voice was not low and musical. There is a
witchery in a soft melodious accent that no language
can describe. It seems to dissolve itself into the soul
and steal us away unconsciously to ourselves. A
lovely mind is the highest charm a woman can possess.
How exquisitely has Lowell pictured in the
following verses, the purity of a young maiden:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poems entitled “My Love,” “Ianthe,” and
“The Lover,” are peculiarly fraught with these elevated
sentiments, and we recommend them, apart
from their poetic merit, to all who love to contemplate
true beauty in woman. The sonnets of Lowell
are equally full of those delicate touches. Those on
names are very fine—the one entitled “Anne” particularly
so. Many others may be instanced as exquisite
poems, full of tenderness and beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all this ideality, this calm enthusiasm, this
love for his fellow men, this freshness and delicacy,
Lowell would be entitled to rank already among the
first poets of the country, if it were not for an occasional
affectation, and a comparative want of artistical
knowledge. His affectation is the result of his
extravagant fondness for Spencer, and partakes, in
a great measure, of the peculiarities of that fine poet.
The most usual forms in which this affectation developes
itself in Lowell, is in a tendency to push his
metaphors to the verge of allegory, and in a quaintness
that is as much out of place as a tie-wig on a
beau of the present generation. The want of artistical
knowledge is only comparative, for Lowell understands
the rules of his art better than nine-tenths
of the craft. Indeed we question whether the slovenliness
of many of his poems, does not arise from
carelessness as much as from ignorance. The writings
of few men betray such rapidity of composition,
evincing clearly to our mind, that the thoughts of the
poet are thrown upon the paper as fast as they bubble
up from his heart. Lowell seems to scorn revision.
He strikes off his poems at a white heat, disdaining
to polish the steel when it has grown cool. Such
neglect always leads to the disbelief in an author’s
artistical skill. The public will never give him the
credit of being a good workman, while he shows so
great an indifference to the finish of his wares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This carelessness is not only evinced in an occasional
false measure, but in other ways more detrimental.
One of the slovenly habits of our poet, is in
the use of the accent to lengthen a short syllable.
We constantly meet with such words as “poisèd”
“inspirèd,” and others of like false quantity. Against
such liberties we protest. It is no argument to tell
us that other poets have been guilty of the practice.
Twenty wrongs do not constitute a right, nor will volumes
of false quantity make a poem. An author
is to take the language as he finds it and evince his
skill by adapting it to his purpose. If every writer
is allowed to beat a short syllable into a long one,
there will soon be as many varieties of accent in our
language, as there are gods in the Chinese theology.
If words may be twisted as we please there will be
no end to the fools who write poems. It is time that
men stood up for the purity of our tongue. The affectations
of Hunt, Lamb, and Hazlit, might have
been forgiven: but the barbarous jargon of Carlyle
deserves to be damned in the first act. There is a
saint in the Brahmin calendar whom a legion of devils
has been tormenting for a thousand years; and the
good old manly English tongue seems to be in much
the same predicament. Every lustrum or two a new
onset is made at its purity. Each successive generation
witnesses a mania for some foreign, illegitimate,
unholy alliance. The rage in the days of Pope was
for the French school, in the days of Johnson for the
Latin school, and just now it is for the German school.
If we live many years longer we shall expect to see
men affecting the negro jargon from Coromantee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The false accentuation of his words is not the only
sin of Lowell against the purity of our tongue. His
poems are disfigured, on almost every page, by the
use of compound words, which he seems to fabricate,
like an editor makes news, to fill out. We
have “dreamy-winged,” “long-agone,” “grass-hid,”
“spring-gladsome,” “moss-rimmed,” “study-withered,”
“over-live,” “maiden-wise,” “rosy-white,”
“full-sailed,” “deep-glowing,” “earth-forgetting,”
“down-gushing,” “cross-folded,” and a host of like
mongrel expressions, which no pure writer would
use, and for which not even the genius of Lowell can
obtain currency. The only redeeming feature in his
case is that his later poems evince a decided improvement
in this respect. They betray comparatively
little of this carelessness. They show a wider command
of words, a more sonorous and elevated verse.
They are less disfigured by affectations from Spencer
and others of the quaint old writers. They begin to
be worthy of the genius of Lowell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have attributed these faults to carelessness;
but they may be the result of affectation. Much of
the unique appearance of the poetry of Lowell, is to
be assigned unquestionably to these very things which
we have denounced as errors. But if intentional the
faults are only the more reprehensible. It is a very
different thing whether a man commits a murder ignorantly
or with malice aforethought. If the first
he may be pardoned; if the second he should be
hanged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earlier poems of Lowell are apt to be as much
overrated by one set of readers, as they are to be depreciated
by another set. The use of obsolete words,
of arbitrary accents, of metaphors that verge on allegory,
commend these poems to a certain school which
seems to caress quaintness with the infatuation
of Queen Titania in kissing the long ears of Bottom.
But there is another school, which, possessing an
honest contempt for any thing like affectation, is in
danger of transferring its dislike from the errors to
the author himself—of questioning his genius because
of the faults of his style. We condemn each
of these schools—both that which exaggerates and
that which depreciates the poet. Lowell has many
of the elements of a great poet inherent in his nature;
while his faults are manifestly acquired, and can be
corrected. His ideality, his enthusiasm, his nobility
of sentiment, would enable him to produce even a
great poem, if to these were added the capacity to
grasp a series of incidents in one vast comprehensive
whole. This capacity, or at least the elements of it,
we believe him to possess, and if he adheres to a
rigid course of study, and awaits the mature development
of his powers, he will be enabled to prove
this to the world. By that time his taste will be
ameliorated and his artistical skill improved. He
now writes rather as his feelings dictate than after
any sustained plan. We must be understood however,
as using this language only comparatively; for
as we have before said, Lowell is already equal in
these respects to most of his cotemporaries. But
there is an empyrean to which none of them have yet
attained. To that region of eternal day we would
have our young countryman aspire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have spoken with frankness, because we love
with discretion. The genius of Lowell is surpassed
by no cotemporary and he has only to be known in
order to be understood; but his countrymen have a
right to interpose and save him from the errors into
which a false taste, a pedantic clique, or indiscriminate
flattery may plunge him. He cannot wholly
resist the peculiarities of the approaching school, but
there is no reason why he should not soften their
errors and elevate their style. He can display
the taste of Coleridge without his absurdities, he can
be as intellectual as Shelley without his mysticism,
he can emulate the ideality of Tennyson and Keats
without the affectation of the one, or the redundancy
of the other. He has high genius, susceptible of improvement,
but capable of perversion. He is in that
critical period of a poet’s life when the intoxication
of success may lead to idleness, when the misguided
silence of his friends may confirm him in his worst
faults. The improvement which his later poems
evince, fill us with high hopes for the future; but his
task is not yet done, as his powers are still in the
process of development. If we were his bosom
friend we should speak as we have written, using
that noble sentence as our apology, “strike, but hear
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We look forward to the future career of Lowell,
with hope, not unmingled, however, with fear and
trembling. To his hands, we fondly trust, has been
committed the task of achieving a great original
American poem, a work that shall silence the sneers
of foreigners, and write his own name amid the
stars of heaven. He has the dormant intellect which
if rightly disciplined, will enable him to fulfil this
mission. But let him bide his time. Let him husband
his powers, and yet not let them rust in idleness;
but gird up his loins for the work that is before him,
so that when the day of his translation shall arrive
he may lift up his eyes for the chariot of fire. If he
does his mission aright the hour of his rejoicing will
surely come. No power will be able to avert it.
Against the revilings of the envious, against the
sneers of the unbelieving, against the persecution of
hostile powers he can bear himself proudly up, for
the sight of the fiery chariot will swim before his
eyes and the sounds of celestial harmonies entrance
his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We take leave of Lowell with a single word. He
must not be discouraged if his genius should at first
be questioned. Few prophets have honor in their
own country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My fever had been excessive and of long duration.
All the remedies attainable in this wild Appennine
region had been exhausted to no purpose. My valet
and sole attendant in the lonely chateau, was too
nervous and too grossly unskilful to venture upon
letting blood—of which indeed I had already lost too
much in the affray with the banditti. Neither could
I safely permit him to leave me in search of assistance.
At length I bethought me of a little pacquet
of opium which lay with my tobacco in the hookah-case;
for at Constantinople I had acquired the habit
of smoking the weed with the drug. Pedro handed
me the case. I sought and found the narcotic. But
when about to cut off a portion I felt the necessity of
hesitation. In smoking it was a matter of little importance
<span class='it'>how much</span> was employed. Usually, I had
half filled the bowl of the hookah with opium and
tobacco cut and mingled intimately, half and half.
Sometimes when I had used the whole of this mixture
I experienced no very peculiar effects; at other
times I would not have smoked the pipe more than
two-thirds out, when symptoms of mental derangement,
which were even alarming, warned me to
desist. But the effect proceeded with an easy gradation
which deprived the indulgence of all danger.
Here, however, the case was different. I had never
<span class='it'>swallowed</span> opium before. Laudanum and morphine
I had occasionally used, and about <span class='it'>them</span> should have
had no reason to hesitate. But the solid drug I had
never seen employed. Pedro knew no more respecting
the proper quantity to be taken, than myself—and
thus, in the sad emergency, I was left altogether to
conjecture. Still I felt no especial uneasiness; for I
resolved to proceed <span class='it'>by degrees</span>. I would take a <span class='it'>very</span>
small dose in the first instance. Should this prove
impotent, I would repeat it; and so on, until I should
find an abatement of the fever, or obtain that sleep
which was so pressingly requisite, and with which
my reeling senses had not been blessed for now more
than a week. No doubt it was this very reeling of
my senses—it was the dull delirium which already
oppressed me—that prevented me from perceiving
the incoherence of my reason—which blinded me to
the folly of defining any thing as either large or small
where I had no preconceived standard of comparison.
I had not, at the moment, the faintest idea that what
I conceived to be an exceedingly small dose of solid
opium might, in fact, be an excessively large one.
On the contrary I well remember that I judged confidently
of the quantity to be taken by reference to the
entire quantity of the lump in possession. The portion
which, in conclusion, I swallowed, and swallowed
without fear, was no doubt a very small proportion
<span class='it'>of the piece which I held in my hand</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chateau into which Pedro had ventured to
make forcible entrance rather than permit me, in
my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night
in the open air, was one of those fantastic piles of
commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long
frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than
in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it
had been temporarily and very lately abandoned.
Day by day we expected the return of the family
who tenanted it, when the misadventure which had
befallen me would, no doubt, be received as sufficient
apology for the intrusion. Meantime, that this
intrusion might be taken in better part, we had established
ourselves in one of the smallest and least
sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay high in a
remote turret of the building. Its decorations were
rich, yet tattered and antique. Its walls were hung
with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform
armorial trophies, together with an unusually
great number of very spirited modern paintings in
frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings,
which depended from the walls not only in their
main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the
bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary—in
these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps,
had caused me to take deep interest; so that
having swallowed the opium, as before told, I bade
Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room—since
it was already night—to light the tongues of a tall
candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed—and
to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains
of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I
wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not
to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of
these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume
which had been found upon the pillow, and which
purported to criticise and describe them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long—long I read—and devoutly, devotedly I
gazed. I felt meantime, the voluptuous narcotic
stealing its way to my brain. I felt that in its magical
influence lay much of the gorgeous richness and
variety of the frames—much of the ethereal hue that
gleamed from the canvas—and much of the wild interest
of the book which I perused. Yet this consciousness
rather strengthened than impaired the delight
of the illusion, while it weakened the illusion
itself. Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by,
and the deep midnight came. The position of the
candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my
hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering
valet, I so placed it as to throw its rays more
fully upon the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated.
The rays of the numerous candles (for
there were many) now fell within a niche of the
room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade
by one of the bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a
picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of
a young girl just ripened into womanhood. I glanced
at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes.
Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my
own perception. But while my lids remained thus
shut, I ran over in mind my reason for so shutting
them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time
for thought—to make sure that my vision had not deceived
me—to calm and subdue my fancy for a more
sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments
I again looked fixedly at the painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That I now saw aright I could not and would not
doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that
canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor
which was stealing over my senses, and to startle
me into waking life as if with the shock of a galvanic
battery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The portrait, I have already said, was that of a
young girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done
in what is technically termed a <span class='it'>vignette</span> manner;
much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully.
The arms, the bosom and even the ends of the radiant
hair, melted imperceptibly into the vague yet
deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the
whole. The frame was oval, richly, yet fantastically
gilded and filagreed. As a work of art nothing
could be more admirable than the painting itself.
The loveliness of the face surpassed that of the fabulous
Houri. But it could have been neither the execution
of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the
countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently
moved me. Least of all could it have been
that my fancy, shaken from its half-slumber, had
mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw
at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the
<span class='it'>vignetting</span> and of the frame must have instantly dispelled
such idea—must have prevented even its momentary
entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon
these points, I remained, for some hours perhaps,
half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted
upon the portrait. At length, satisfied of the true
secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had
found the spell of the picture in a perfect <span class='it'>life-likeliness</span>
of expression, which at first startling, finally
confounded, subdued and appalled me. I could no
longer support the sad meaning smile of the half-parted
lips, nor the too real lustre of the wild eye.
With a deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum
in its former position. The cause of my deep
agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly
the volume which discussed the paintings and
their histories. Turning to the number which designated
the oval portrait, I there read the vague and
quaint words which follow:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not
more lovely than full of glee. And evil was the hour
when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter.
He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already
a bride in his Art: she a maiden of rarest beauty
and not more lovely than full of glee: all light and
smiles and frolicksome as the young fawn: loving
and cherishing all things: hating only the Art which
was her rival: dreading only the pallet and brushes
and other untoward instruments which deprived her
of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a
terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak
of his desire to portray even his young bride. But
she was humble and obedient and sat meekly for
many weeks in the dark high turret-chamber where
the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from
overhead. But he, the painter, took glory in his
work, which went on from hour to hour and from
day to day. And he was a passionate, and wild and
moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he
<span class='it'>would</span> not see that the light which fell so ghastily in
that lone turret withered the health and the spirits
of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet
she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because
she saw that the painter, (who had high renown,)
took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and
wrought day and night to depict her who so loved
him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak.
And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of
its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel
and a proof not less of the power of the painter than
of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly
well. But at length, as the labor drew
nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none
into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with
the ardor of his work, and turned his visage from
the canvas rarely, even to regard the countenance
of his wife. And he <span class='it'>would</span> not see that the tints
which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from
the cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when
many weeks had passed, and but little remained to
do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon
the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as
the flame within the socket of the lamp. And then
the brush was given, and then the tint was placed;
and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced
before the work which he had wrought; but in the
next, while yet he gazed, he grew tremulous and
very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice

<div><h1><a id='mine'></a>THE MINER’S FATE.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>FROM THE PORT-FOLIO OF A RAMBLING ARTIST.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bright fresh May morning smiled upon one of
the loveliest landscapes in nature, and revealed to
the eye of a wandering young artist a picture of such
exceeding beauty, that he found it impossible to confine
his attention to his canvas sufficiently long to
produce the faintest semblance of the loveliness
which reigned and revelled around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a grand effect is produced on that magnificent
amphitheatre of hills by the sunrise purpling
their rising mist as it ascends and imperceptibly
mingles with the rose-colored clouds—while its base
is wrapped in the cold blue tint which the stronger
rays of the sun will presently disperse. If I could
catch the hue of that many-tinted mist, and throw
over it the soft dreamy haze which clothes the atmosphere,
I should more than rival the mighty master,
Claude Lorraine—one more trial; such a scene must
inspire the humblest artist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He re-arranged a small easel as he spoke, and proceeded
to cover his pallet with the choicest and most
exquisite colors; but the glories of <span class='it'>outre mêr</span> and
carmine seemed so pale and faded before the inexpressible
radiance of earth and ether, that long before
he had finished laying on the dead coloring of
his picture, he threw it aside in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must complete it,” he said, “at some other time
when the majesty of nature may not mock my humble
efforts.” He then arose, and re-packing his paint-box,
deposited it safely among the mossy rocks, and
sauntered slowly onward, to enjoy at least, if he
could not imitate, the enchantments of nature. And
truly he might well give up his heart to the passionate
love of beauty which pervaded it; for the
loveliness of that quiet valley was well calculated to
gratify the intense desires of a mind thirsting for
images of perfection. Not only did the mountain
tops and mist gleam with the golden sunlight, but
every flower at his feet, every blade of grass displayed
each its wealth of gem-like dew glittering
with unrivalled colors.</p>

<p class='noindent'>filled the scented air, and shed their “music of many
murmurings” upon his path; and he was inclined to
fancy that no new feature could add beauty to the
landscape around, when a sudden turn in the winding
path convinced him of his error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had turned his back on the semi-circular range
of hills, and emerged into a tract of country much
more extensive, though still very broken. Huge
masses of rock salt, covered with crystals whose
prismatic forms lent them a startling brilliancy,
gleamed upon his sight, and the green sweep of
land between was diversified by many small cottages
built of the gray rock which abounded throughout
the country. The narrow path bordered with vines
and wild roses lured him on, until the sweet accents
of a female voice broke upon his ear, and he found
that his path would lead him to trespass upon the enclosure
of a cottage which appeared to be one of the
neatest and best arranged among them. The painter
paused, and his eye, (that morning destined to agreeable
surprises,) readily discovered a group without
the door, which immediately called out his pencil
and pocket port-folio. A very bright-eyed child had
thrown his chubby little arms around his father’s
neck, and seemed resolved upon detaining him from
his day’s labor; while the young wife, with eyes and
lips scarcely less bright than those of the child,
vainly endeavored to attract the infant with the most
enticing toys. At length the father succeeded in unclasping
the dimpled hands, and placing the baby on
the floor; but the child still endeavored to detain him
by holding the skirts of his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Philip seems determined that you shall not go
to-day,” said the young woman; “perhaps there is
a meaning in his warning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I listened to all your signs and warnings, I
should very seldom leave you,” replied the husband.
“I must go and that quickly, in spite of my persevering
little pet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will come back very soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot even promise that,” replied the miner;
for the husband was a laborer in the extensive salt
mines, whose crystallizations produce so beautiful
an effect in the distance. “We have a tremendous
piece of work before us to-day, and there is no telling
when it will be finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would to God it were safely over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look so pale and frightened, Mary; worse
jobs are done every day—but they will call me sluggard
if I loiter here—so good-bye, good-bye, darlings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven preserve you,” responded the wife; and
she turned with feelings half of dread and half of
hope to the cottage door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just such a morning,” muttered an old woman
who sat crouching in the chimney corner—“just
such a morning, bright as this,—and a black night followed
the bright day—a black, black night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the saints save us!” exclaimed the young
woman: “who ever heard Dame Ursula talking
away at such a rate before? As sure as fate something
unusual will happen. What is it you were saying
grand-dame?” she added in a louder tone, approaching
the thin, withered old hag who had crept
slowly toward the door-step, and seating herself
there, continued to mutter and mumble half indistinct
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storms follow the sunshine—storms and tempests
and thick darkness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anxious wife followed and sat down beside
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there any evil hanging over us? for mercy
sake tell me if you know,” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evil, did I say Evil! I spoke of the past, not the
future—I spoke of the days of youth and hope and
beauty.” Then as her wandering memory gradually
linked together the chain of by-gone associations, her
countenance brightened, and she poured into the ear
of her astonished auditor the narrative of events
which had taken place nearly a century before, and
were generally forgotten,—treasured only in the
heart of that desolate, and decrepid old creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Youth and beauty, and love I said, and you marvelled
at hearing such words from my lips; no wonder,
for many a year has passed since these things
have been aught to me save idle dreams. But the
time has been, when I too was young—loving and
loved—blessing and blessed. My brother, your grandfather,
and myself were left, you know, in early life
as orphans in the hands of strangers; and although
we had no claim on them except that of helplessness,
and could only repay their kindness by our exertions,
we had no reason ever to complain of harshness or
ill-treatment among our kind and simple people. I
was older than my brother, and as I grew up to be
a tall handsome lass, the young men of the village
strove which could make themselves most agreeable
to the light hearted and beautiful Ursula. I know it
is folly in me to talk so now, and you can scarcely
believe it, but eighty years hence, if you should live
so long, your cheek may be wrinkled and your eye
bleared like mine, so that your laughing boy will
scarcely credit the tale of your former beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven forbid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if not,” resumed the crone, “the change
may be far more fearful—but where was I? Oh—a
merry romping lass of eighteen, with blue eyes,
fair curling locks and red ripe lips—admired by all
the village—but above all the favored choice of young
Albert Wessenbery. The handsomest, bravest, noblest
being! I wish you could have seen him, Mary, in
all his pride of vast strength, and perfection of manly
beauty. Words cannot express the love with
which I loved him. A lifelong loneliness has proved
it. Well, as I told you, I was his choice, and consequently
the envy of all my acquaintances, for no
one thought of denying that Albert Wessenbery was
the pride of the village. So powerful, so stately, so
devoted to me,—well, well! our wedding day was
fixed, and the bridesmaids appointed. A week before—yes,
just seven days before our wedding was to
have taken place, I bade farewell to Albert for a day
only, I believed. Just such a day as this, it was—and
perhaps that is the reason why the soft clear sunshine,
and the sweet sounds in the air have called up
all these old memories so freshly. He pressed me in
his arms and bade me farewell till evening. I dreaded
his going out to work that day, for there was
dangerous duty to be done; but he went in spite of
my entreaties, and from that hour to this, I have
never seen him return. I remember but dimly what
followed. A stunning shock as if an avalanche had
overwhelmed me. Death to him was worse than
death to me. They told me he had perished in the
mine. I know not whether they spoke truly. I
have known nothing clearly since that time. I remember
only that the light was removed from my
path, and that the blackness of madness gathered
round me for a while. How long this lasted I know
not—when I arose from my bed of sickness, my heart
and my flesh failed me, and I was as useless and decrepid
as if years had passed over my head. Since
that time I have struggled on through a long life of
darkness and misery, dragging on a useless and tedious
existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh say not useless my good friend; have you
not while you had strength, given to others the happiness
which fate denied you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother gave me a home in his chimney
corner, and here have I lived more years than I can
count, and for what? God knows—perhaps I may
yet live to see Albert return. I cannot fancy him
altered as I am. I cannot help hoping to see him
once more as he was of old. Vain as the hope may
seem to you—that hope has been the only happiness
I have known since he left me—the only hope. Of
what other use am I in the world? why should I
live? what other use? what other hope?” So speaking
and shaking her palsied head, she relapsed into
her former half unconscious state, occasionally muttering
words to which her young companion listened
with strained attention; but she could hear no
more, neither did she succeed in again arousing the
old woman from her apathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Artist sauntered idly onward until he reached
the mines; here finding that the reflection of the
noon-tide brilliancy from the crystals was painful to
the eyesight, he descended into one of the deepest
excavations, where he found his acquaintance of the
morning, and a fellow labourer at work. The day’s
work was a heavy one, for they were opening a
communication between the mines, and in heaving
up the massive rocks there was great danger of being
buried alive beneath their crumbling weight.
Such things had often happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a mass which requires more strength
than we can furnish,” said Philip, and he shouted for
help. The desired assistance arrived, and after an
hour’s severe labor, the huge rock was heaved upwards.
This removal disclosed a solid stratum of the
salt for which they were toiling; but the attainment of
the object of their labor called forth no expression of
pleasure from the beholders, for the attention of every
one was riveted upon a strange and unlooked for apparition.
Extended upon this singular couch, lay
the form of a young man, apparently not more than
twenty years of age; his limbs were exquisitely
moulded, and he looked as if but yesterday he had
been hushed in the deep sleep of death. It was
evident to the minds of all, that many years must
have elapsed since the being they had thus disinterred,
had been overwhelmed with destruction in
attempting to move that massive weight; for many
years had passed since that portion of the mine had
been worked upon. But was his destruction instantaneous?
or did he linger on, day after day, in vain
hope for the help which came not? how long had
that crystalized rock been his mausoleum? who was
he? where were his kindred? Here was a wide
field for conjecture. Could no one remember that
form which might have passed for a sculptured image
of Antinous? But stranger than all this, the body
seemed utterly untouched by the hand of time. The
very pliability of the flesh remained! Destruction
had passed harmlessly by that glorious form, and
decomposition had not come near it. There he lay—he,
whose existence none could remember—life-like,
and beautiful—embalmed as it were in the solid rock.
The sinewy, and rounded limbs told of the strength
and beauty which had once been theirs, and the long
black hair curled wildly over the clay cold face, and
nerveless shoulders. He was in his ordinary mining
dress, and by his spade and pickaxe beside him,
gave evidence of his final and fatal occupation. The
body was removed, and laid upon the thick green
sward for further inspection, and perhaps recognition.
The news spread rapidly, and the inhabitants
quickly crowded around. None recollected him,
although some of the oldest among them told stories
of such an accident which had happened when they
were little children; but none could remember the
circumstances. After awhile a universal murmur
broke from the crowd, for they beheld their oldest
villager, Dame Ursula, approach with tottering and
unsteady steps, leaning on the arm of a handsome
young female. Not the exhumation of the life-like
corpse itself, produced greater sensation among
them, than the appearance of the living spectre—for
such the old woman appeared, having never left her
home for more than twenty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jesu, Maria—the Saints save us,” were echoed
around her as the crowd respectfully made room
for her to advance. She passed on slowly, and with
difficulty, until she reached the stiff white figure of
the dead miner. Then throwing herself upon the
grass beside him, she passed her withered long
fingers through his hair, and pressed it back from the
pale brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is he, it is he—Albert Wessenbery,” she murmured;
“and it was for this I have been spared
through long years of loneliness, and wretchedness—long,
long years—I knew not why I lived. It was
for this, for this: that I might see him once more,
once more in all his unearthly beauty, in his unmatched
perfection: that I might see, and know that
time has not marred, nor decay changed, nor the
worm defiled the being I have idolized for nearly a
century. Spared too to rejoice that my own Albert
cannot behold the change which time, and life have
wrought in a form he once loved so well. To him
these withered arms and lips are welcome as if they
yet retained all their former loveliness. He will not
reject his early love for her age, and sickness, and
unsightlessness. To him therefore I devote the
remainder of my existence. Here will I fulfil the
vows of love and constancy plighted in the spring
time of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent her head as she spoke and imprinted with
bloodless lips a kiss upon his; her white hair streamed
down, and mingled with his raven tresses, her long
skinny fingers warm with life, pressed the cold marble
hand of the dead! Strange union of youth and
age—beauty and deformity—life and death! Seven
days afterwards they were buried in the same grave,
the superannuated woman, and her youthful lover.
The constancy of a lifetime was rewarded, for she
was permitted to rest her aged and hoary head, upon
the manly, and unaltered breast of him she had loved
so long and so well. Turf and flowers sprung up as
greenly and freely above their grave as if they had
been always young, and beautiful, and happy. Many
a garland of young flowers, and the more lasting
wreaths of the amaranth were hung upon that grave;
and the names of Ursula and Albert, rudely sculptured
on the grey stone which covered them, formed
their only obituary, save the memory which survives
in the hearts of the villagers.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MISS LESLIE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART THE FIRST.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Among the numerous strangers that stop at West
Point, in ascending or in coming down the Hudson,
there are comparatively few who allow themselves
sufficient time to become acquainted with even the
half that is worthy of note, in that extraordinary place—giving
but one day, or perhaps only a few hours,
to a visit which ought at least to comprise a whole
week. A large proportion of these travellers, after
they have hurried through the rooms of the academy,
walked round the camp, witnessed the parade, heard
the band, or perhaps accomplished a hasty survey of
the ruins of Fort Putnam, seem to believe that they
are consequently familiar with all that both nature
and art have done for one of the most beautiful and
interesting spots on the American continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beautiful indeed it is, from its romantic situation
in the midst of the highlands, looking directly
down on one of the finest rivers in the world—and
from its picturesque combinations of mountain, valley
and plain; woodland, rock, and water—scenery to
which no painter has ever yet done justice. And
how intensely interesting are its associations with
the history of our revolutionary contest—when West
Point commanded the passes of the highlands—at
once opposing a barrier to the descent of the enemy
from the lake country and to their ascent from the
ocean. Also amid these hills lay the army of Washington,
at the time it was so providentially saved by
the discovery of Arnold’s treason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, “when the storm of war is gone,” and the
Gibraltar of America finds no farther occasion for its
mountain fortresses, it has become the nucleus from
whence the military science of our country radiates
to its utmost boundaries; the nursery of a body of
officers whose cultivated minds, polished manners,
and high tone of moral feeling, have rendered them
deservedly popular with their compatriots—also eliciting
a favourable testimony even from the British
tourists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a common and, in most instances, a true
remark, that first impressions are lasting: at least
with regard to external objects. My own first impressions
of West Point were received on a lovely
summer evening that succeeded a stormy day. I
had left the city of New York with my brother, at nine
o’clock in the morning, in the slow and unpopular
Richmond; the only boat that went up the river on
that day, and the worst of the three steam-vessels
which at that time comprised the establishment of
what is now termed the old North River Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I need not say that it was during the period of the
charter they had obtained for the exclusive steam-navigation
of the Hudson. In those days, a voyage
from New York to Albany frequently consumed
twenty-four hours, and the fare was ten dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had anticipated the most extatic delight from my
first view of the grand and romantic scenery of this
noble river. But very soon after we left the city a
heavy rain came on, and seemed to have set in for
the whole day. I had recently recovered from a long
illness, and could not venture to remain on the wet
deck, even under the screen of an umbrella. The
canvass awning was so perforated with holes from the
chimney-sparks, that it afforded about as much shelter
as a large sieve. There was no upper cabin, and
I reluctantly compelled myself to quit admiring the
Palisade Rocks and descend to the apartment appropriated
to the ladies. It was very crowded and
perfectly close. The berths were all occupied by
females lying down in their clothes, and trying to
sleep away the tedious hours. The numerous
children were uncomfortable, fretful, and troublesome,
as most children are when they are “cabin’d,
crib’d, confin’d.” Seats were so scarce (when were
they otherwise in a summer steam-boat) that many
of us were glad to place ourselves on the wooden
edges of the lower berths. In this extreme I could
not agree with the old adage that “it is as cheap
sitting as standing:” for if cheapness means convenience
or agreeableness, as is generally supposed, I
found it quite as convenient, and rather more agreeable,
to stand leaning against something, than to sit
on the perpendicular edge of a board. We had not
even the pleasure of regaling our eyes with the handsome
fittings-up that now when there is no monopoly
and great rivalry, are deemed indispensable to the
reputation of an American steam-boat. The old
Richmond was furnished very plainly, alias meanly.
Her cabins had common ingrain carpets of the ugliest
possible patterns, pine tables painted red, and curtains
of coarse dark calico. By the by, reader,
never go to a boarding-house that professes a <span class='it'>plain</span>
table; you will be almost sure to find it a mean one.
Also, never engage a <span class='it'>plain</span> cook—you will be almost
sure to find her no cook at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were nearly all day in the boat, and it rained
incessantly. It was very tantalizing on this, my first
voyage up the Hudson, to obtain only an occasional
glimpse of its beautiful shores through the small
cabin windows, which windows were always monopolized
by nurse-maids, seated on the transom
with their babies; the babies taking no interest in
the scenery, and their nurses still less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we came into the highlands, the storm had
increased, and my first view of them was caught by
ever-interrupted glances through a few inches of
window-pane, and by peeping over the head of a girl
whose eyes were all the time wandering among the
people in the interior of the cabin. These sublime
mountains loomed green and dimly through the rain-mist
that veiled their rocky sides, and their towering
heads were lost in the volumes of fantastic clouds
that rolled around them. But it proved what is called
the clearing up shower; and just as we were rounding
that low projection of bare rock that runs far out
into the river, and forms the extreme point of West
Point, the clouds began to part in the zenith, and the
blue sky appeared between them, and the sun
suddenly broke out lighting up the western sides of
the hills and pouring his full effulgence on the river.
We landed just as the evening parade was about to
commence, and I saw it from the front windows of
an apartment that commanded a full view. It was
a beautiful scene; on this spacious and level plain,
elevated about a hundred and sixty feet above the
river, which bounds it on the north and east, while
on the south and west it is hemmed in by the mountains
that rise directly from it. The numerous windows
of the barracks were sparkling and burnishing
in the setting sun that was beaming out below the
retiring clouds, throwing a rosy tint on the white
tents of the camp, and glittering on the bayonets of
the long line of cadets drawn up for the exercise that,
at a military post always concludes the day. The
band was playing delightfully, and the effect of the
whole was very striking at the moment when the
drums rolled, the evening gun went off, the flag came
down, and the officers all drew their swords and advanced
to the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many circumstances contributed to render my
first visit to West Point peculiarly pleasant. I had
never in my life spent three weeks so agreeably.
Subsequently, I resided there nearly two years in
the family of my brother. I have enjoyed the grand
and lovely scenery of West Point under all the various
aspects of the seasons. I have been there when
the late, but rapid spring, with its balmy breathings,
and its soft sun-light, suddenly awakens the long-slumbering
vegetation of these high and northerly
regions, when you can almost <span class='it'>see</span> the forming of the
buds and their bursting into leaf; while patches of
the last snow yet linger here and there about the
cavities of the rocks, and in the hollows that lie
among the roots of the trees, “on their cold and
winter-shaded side.” At the same time, in the
warmer recesses of the forests, the early flowers of
the hepatica and the violet are finding their way up
amid the dead leaves which the wild blasts of November
have strewed thickly over the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These mountains are wooded from the base to the
summit, (except where a block of granite looks out
from amid the trees,) and in the month of May they
are variegated with all those countless and exquisite
shades of green, that can only emanate from the hand
of that Great Painter that colored the Universe.
While some of these inimitable tints are dark almost to
blackness, and some are of the richest olive, others
present in endless variety, the numerous gradations
of deep-green, blue-green, grass-green, apple-green,
pea-green, and yellow-green; the catalpa and the
locust, with their clusters of pencilled blossoms, and
the dogwood with its milk-white flowers, supplying
the bright lights of the picture. Then, in looking up
the river, the long perspective is closed at the utmost
verge of the horizon by the far-off Taghcanoke
mountains: the snows that still rest on their cold and
lonely summits extending in streaks of whiteness
half-way down their dim blue sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a stranger at West Point the commencement
of a summer’s day has many circumstances of novelty
and excitement that are almost lost upon those to
whom custom has rendered them familiar. With
the earliest blush of dawn, and at the third tap of the
drum, the morning gun goes off, and when the wind
is in a certain direction, I have heard its loud booming
sound five times repeated by the mountain echoes,
“fainter and fainter still”—but always distinctly
audible. At the same moment the flag is run up, and
flings out to the early breeze its waving folds of stars
and stripes denoting that the place is United States’
ground, a military post, and under martial law. These

<p class='noindent'>followed by a medley of popular airs, each one concluding
like a rondo, with—“The lark is up,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is beautiful on a soft summer morning to look
out upon these forest-cinctured mountains, when
there has been a rain during the night, and to see the
misty clouds veiling their summits and rolling off
from their sides; breaking, as the sun ascends, into
thin white wreaths that creep slowly about the glens,
and gradually losing all distinctness of form and
blending with the blue of ether. More beautiful still
is the broad expanse of the Hudson, glittering with
the golden sun-light, and reflecting the clear cerulean
of the sky; while the white-sailed sloops seem to
slumber on the calm surface of the water, as each
“floats double, <span class='it'>sloop</span> and shadow,” and near the
shore the dark mountains and the rocky precipices
cast their deep masses of shade upon the liquid
mirror below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was once at West Point when the dawn of our
national anniversary was ushered in by the roar of
artillery from amid the ruins of Fort Putnam, the
guns having been previously conveyed up the mountain
for that purpose. There is a history belonging
to these guns. They were originally French; and
are engraved with the name of the foundry at which
they were cast; bearing also the three <span class='it'>fleur de lis</span> of
the <span class='it'>ancien regime</span>, the cypher of Louis the Fourteenth,
(who at that time, filled the throne of France)
and the celebrated motto which he ordered to be inscribed
on all his cannon—“<span class='it'>Ultimo ratio regum.</span>”
The guns in question were sent to Quebec, and were
taken by the English on the heights of Abraham, in
that eventful battle, when both commanders fell in
the same hour that transferred the dominion of
Canada from France to England. Belonging afterwards
to the army of Burgoyne, they became the
property of America on the surrender at Saratoga,
and finally were presented by Congress to the Military
Academy. At the cadets annual ball I have
seen these guns decorated with wreaths of laurel,
and arranged as ornaments along a covered promenade,
lighted up with lamps in front of the ball-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the dwellers on the plain below, the effect on the
aforesaid fourth of July was indescribably fine; the
guns thundering and echoing in a region so far above
us, their gleams of fire flashing out amid the clouds
of white smoke that rolled their eddying volumes
round the old dismantled ramparts. The salute was
followed by a full burst of martial harmony from the
band, who had also gone up into the ruins; all playing
so admirably and in such perfect unison, that the
whole of their various instruments sounded like one
alone—but like one whose grand and exquisite tones
seemed scarcely to belong to earth. The band had
their fourth of July dinner within the dilapidated
recesses of the moss-grown fortress, and frequently
during the day, we heard their music. Sometimes
the soft sweet warblings of the octave flute rose
alone upon the air; then the clear melodious tones
of Willis’s bugle seemed to “lap the soul in Elysium;”
then came the clarionets deepened by the trombone;
and finally the loud and thrilling notes of the bass-drum
struck grandly in, and swelled the full tide of
sound till the rocks seemed to tremble with its reverberations.
Music, like painting, has its lights and
shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing can be more lovely than the scenery about
West Point when lighted up by the beams of the
summer moon. While there, I was once on a water
party, in a delightful evening towards the close of
the “leafy month of June.” The gentlemen attached
to the military academy had made arrangements
for taking the ladies on a moonlight voyage through
the highlands, in the boats belonging to the post.
Of these boats I think there were eight. The first
and largest was appropriated to the band—in the
others followed the professors connected with the
institution, the officers, and the ladies—with soldiers
as oarsmen. We were rowed to the upper extremity
of the highlands, beyond Butter Hill which, notwithstanding
its homely name, is a magnificent mountain
with a gradual slope on the land-side, but presenting
to the water a perpendicular precipice in height
sixteen hundred feet. In the clefts of this lofty rock
tradition has asserted that the pirate Blackbeard deposited
portions of his treasure more than a century
ago. It is not many years since a gentleman who
believed the story, was killed by losing his hold, and
falling down backwards upon the stones below, in
a desperate attempt to scale the precipice in quest
of the rover’s gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we embarked on our aquatic excursion “the
moon arose curtained in clouds which her beams
gradually dispelled.” When she climbed above
them, as they “turned forth their silver linings to
the night,” and her rays touched the top of the
eastern hills, while their dark sides reposed in
shadow, I thought of a song in the Carnival of
Venice.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And dips in concert to the sound.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having ascended beyond the inner highlands, our
boats were put about. The men resting on their
oars we floated down with the tide nearly as far as
the Dunderberg, and never did this picturesque and
romantic region look more lovely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of our little voyage several steam-boats
passed us: and all of them slackened their
steam awhile, for the purpose of remaining longer
in our vicinity that the passengers might enjoy the
music. One of these boats, in stopping to hear us, lay
directly on the broad line of moonlight that was
dancing and glittering on the water, the red glare of
her lanterns strangely mingling with the golden
radiance beneath. Our band was just then playing
the Hunter’s Chorus, that ever-charming composition
which justly merits its universal popularity in
every part of the world where music is known, and
which would alone have been sufficient to entitle
Weber to his tomb in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing can be finer than the atmospheric phenomena
of these elevated regions. I remember one
afternoon, when the sun was breaking out on the
close of a summer shower, we seemed to find ourselves
in the midst of an immense rain-bow which
appeared to have descended upon the plain. The
camp, the south barracks, the trees, and the eastern
hills beyond the river were all brightly colored with
its varied and beautiful tints, and looked as if seen
through an immense prism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thunder storm in these mountains is sublime
beyond all that imagination can conceive. In looking
up the river, while the sun is yet shining brightly,
and the sky is blue above our heads, we see a dark
cloud far off in the direction of Newburgh, whose
white houses stand out in strong relief against the
deep gloom that has gathered beyond; the coming
vapor rises and spreads till it appears behind the
Crow’s Nest, casting its deep shade upon the tops
of the mountains, while on their sides still linger the
last gleams of sunshine. As the clouds accumulate,
and unite their forces, the darkness descends upon
the river, whose blackening surface is seen ruffled
with spots of white foam; the zig-zag lightning
begins to quiver up from the gloom behind the hills;
and then is heard the low murmur of the distant
thunder; every flash becoming brighter, every peal
sounding louder and nearer. At length, the wind
rises, and the whole tempest rushes rapidly on. The
trees writhe and bend to their roots, and are soon
covered with the circling dust of the whirl-wind.
The lightning glares out in one vast sheet, “flashing
intolerable day” upon the night-like darkness that
shrouds the river and its shores. At the same
instant, the loud crash of the thunder rattles directly
over head, and it continues throughout the storm its
long and incessant roll, the echoes of one peal not
subsiding before those of another have commenced.
The lightning glances on the bayonets of the centinels
that “walk their lonely rounds” on the skirts of the
camp; and frequently the tents are blown over by
the violence of the gust, and lie prostrate on the wet
grass. These terrific thunder-claps seem to shake
the everlasting hills; the firm-set granite buildings of
the institution trembling to their foundations. Often
the tremendous power delegated to “the volleying
bolt of heaven” is attested by a riven and blasted
tree, split in a moment from its topmost spray down
to its roots in the earth; while, at the same instant,
every leaf of its green and flourishing foliage becomes
dead and yellow, the birds that built their nests
among its branches lying lifeless at its foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recommend to all visiters at the West Point hotel
not to neglect ascending to the belvidere or skylight
room on the top of that building. The view from
thence is so vast and so magnificent that it rarely
fails to call forth exclamations of delighted astonishment;
particularly when autumn has colored the
woods with its glowing and varied tints of scarlet,
crimson, and purple, and with every shade of brown
and yellow from the richest to the palest—such tints
as, at this season, are to be found only in the foliage
of America, and are most beautiful when seen
through the gauzy haze of the Indian summer—that
farewell smile of the departing year. Then the
dilated disk of the sun looks round and red through
its thin misty veil; the calm and slumbering river
reflects a sky of the mildest blue; and near the shores
its waters glow with the inverted beauties of the
many-colored woods and hills. If viewed at evening,
the splendor of the picture is increased by the
glories of an autumnal sunset, when the clouds
(such as are only seen in mountainous regions)
assume the grandest forms and the most gorgeous
hues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often after the last lingering beam has faded in the
west, and all the stars have come out in the deep
blue heaven, a dark mist appears behind the hills in
the north, and from its dun recesses arise the ever-changing
corruscations of the mysterious aurora borealis.
Sometimes, its broad rays extend upwards nearly
to the zenith, and diffuse a cold strange light upon
the river and its western banks, rendering perfectly
distinct the sloops on the water, and the trees and
rocks on the shore. In the houses on the bank, the
front-rooms are at times so well lighted by this
incomprehensible phenomenon, that a newspaper
may be read after the lamps or candles have been
removed from the apartment. Then, perhaps in a
few minutes, “the north’s dancing streamers relinquished
their fire,” and faded dimly away into darkness.
Suddenly they would again revive, darting
upwards in renewed brightness their far-spreading
rays, tinted with crimson and purple, and sometimes
even with green and blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a chamber that I once occupied at West Point
there was a small knot-hole in the upper part of one
of the shutters, by means of which, in cold weather,
when the windows were closed fast, and the room
consequently darkened, I frequently at early morning
saw as in a camera obscura, a landscape depicted
on the white wall above the mantel-piece. So that
before I was up myself, I could observe the first
gleams of the dawnlight, and the changing colors of
the clouds as they brightened upon the blue sky,
lending their glories to the hills beyond the river:
and the first rays of the sun, when they “fired the
proud tops of the eastern pines.” In this way, without
opening the shutters to look out, I could always
tell whether the morning was clear or cloudy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winter at West Point is long and cold; and
(before the days of rail roads,) when the river was
once closed, the ice fast, and the boats laid up for
the season, the inhabitants of this insulated spot
seemed nearly shut out from all communication with
the rest of the world; and it may easily be guessed
what interest was attached to the mails, after the
difficulties of transportation caused them to arrive
irregularly. We were very soon convinced of the
fact that</p>

<p class='line0'>“When cold and raw the wind doth blow</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Bleak in the morning early,</p>
<p class='line0'>When all the hills are cover’d with snow</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Then it is winter fairly.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I have known the snow so deep and so drifted, as
to block up the parlor windows of the house we then
inhabited, precluding all possibility of opening the
shutters; and as to clear it away was no trifling task,
we were more than once obliged to breakfast by
candle-light at eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the “blue serene” of the clear and intensely
cold mornings, which usually succeeded a deep fall of
snow, I have seen the whole atmosphere glittering
with minute particles of ice: to breathe which must,
in delicate lungs, have caused a sensation similar to
laceration with a sharp knife. No one afflicted with
pulmonary disease should live at West Point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scenery, in its winter aspect, looked somewhat
like a panorama done in Indian ink, or rather like a
great etching: except that the sky formed a blue
background to the snowy mountains, on which the
leafless branches of the denuded forest seemed
pencilled in black and gray. We had our winter
walks too: and I never felt a more pleasant glow
from exercise than in climbing Mount Independence,
through the snow, to visit Fort Putnam. In addition
to the ordinary steepness of the road, it was now in
many places rendered slippery by broad sheets of ice,
beneath which we saw the living waters of a mountain
brook gliding and murmuring along under their
glassy coating. The snow had drifted high among
the recesses of the old fortress, and lay white and
thick along the broken and roofless edges of its dark
gray walls, while here and there, amid the desolation,
lingered the evergreen of a lonely cedar. Long
bright icicles suspended their transparent and glittering
fringes from the arches of the dismantled casements,
whose entrances were now even less accessible
than usual, being blocked up with mounds of snow
that covered the heaps of fallen stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of our favorite winter walks was to the cascade;
and on entering the close woods that led
thither, we always felt a sensible access of warmth
in the atmosphere, which was very agreeable when
compared to the unsheltered bleakness of the plain.
In looking down from the heights, through the steeps
of the forest, we saw glimpses of the river, as it lay
far below us; its solid waters now of a bluish-white,
shining beneath the wintry sun. Yet the cascade
still poured its resistless torrent freely among the
snow-covered rocks, roaring, frothing, and pitching
from ledge to ledge. An old pine tree had thrown
itself horizontally across the upper fall, its dark
green foliage almost touching the water, and its
rough trunk forming a bridge for the passage of the
minks, foxes, ground squirrels, and other petty denizens
of the wild. As the foaming torrent threw up
its misty spray, this tree became incrusted with
ice of the most brilliant transparency; looking like
an immense chandelier, with multitudes of long
crystal drops depending from its feathery branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last winter I spent at West Point a funeral
took place in the middle of December. It was that
of a gentleman attached to the institution, and he
died after a long and painful illness. The river had
closed at a very early period, and the little world of
West Point was locked up in ice and snow. Three
o’clock was the time appointed for the melancholy
procession to take up its line of march; the coffin,
covered with a pall, having been previously carried
into the chapel, and the funeral service performed
over it by the chaplain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a clear, cold afternoon, and the sun was
already sinking behind the mountains, whose giant
shadows, magnificently colored with crimson and
purple, were projected far forward upon the frozen
snow that covered the plain; as a range of painted
windows cast down their glowing tints upon a white
marble pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the funeral began to move from the chapel,
the band (preceding the coffin) commenced one of
the mournful airs that are usually appropriated to
“the march of death.” The muffled drums were
struck only at long intervals, and their heavy notes
were deadened still more by the chillness of the
atmosphere; while Willis’s bugle sounded almost
like music from the world of spirits. Next came
the soldiers, then the cadets, afterwards the officers,
and lastly the commandant; all walking with their
arms inverted. I saw the sad and lonely procession
moving slowly through the snow, and directing its
course to the cemetery, which is about a mile from
the plain. Shaded with ancient trees, the grave
yard occupies the summit of a promontory that
impends above the river; and the Cadet’s Monument
crowned by its military trophy in white marble,
forms one of the land marks of the shore. I heard
(and it always seems to me the most affecting part of
the ceremonial) the volley which was fired over the
grave, after that cold and narrow cell had been covered
in with clods of frozen earth mingled with snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very extraordinary circumstance connected with
military funerals is the custom, that when all is over,
and the procession is returning with recovered arms,
and marching in quick time, the music always performs
a lively air; frequently one that is designated in
the army as, “So went the merry man home to his
grave.” This revolting practice is said to have
originated in the same principle that is set forth in
the commencing lines of the well-known song, said
to have been sung by General Wolfe at his supper
table on the night before the battle in which he was
killed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>But few among those who constitute the educated
portion of society on shore, enjoy much opportunity
of feeling the grandeur,—the awful variety of night.
Women are necessarily debarred from the privilege
of partaking freely of its mysterious but ennobling
influence by the restraints unfortunately requisite for
their protection; and, in order to reap the full advantage
of such communion, we must be <span class='it'>alone</span> with
the queen of the ebon wand and starry diadem. As
for those of the bolder sex,—by them, the hours of
shade are usually devoted to study, pleasure, or dissipation,
and only the few possessing the poetic temperament
become familiar with her changeful moods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, on the ocean, the closeness of the cabin
drives the novice frequently on deck, even in stormy
weather and at unseasonable hours; and when once
this compulsory introduction has been effected, it is
surprising how rapidly the traveller, of either sex,
becomes enamored of solitude and night—of starlight
and the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The changes in the heavens,—and the waters too—are
quite as numerous and far more impressive by
night than by day.—There is no sameness in the sea
for those who are blest with capacity to feel the
beauties of Nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us lounge away an hour of this lovely evening
here, by the companion-way. We are between
the trades, and time would hang heavily on
our hands but for the baffling winds and tempting
cats-paws that keep us perpetually on the alert to
gain or save a mile of southing.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> At present, we
are suffering all the tedium of a calm. How dark!—How
absolutely black the sky appears, contrasted
with the brightness of a tropical moon! And yon
dazzling star, waving its long line of reflected rays
athwart the glassy billows, rivalling the broad glare
of the moonlight!—What diamond ever equalled it
in lustre, or surpassed it in variety of hues, as its
ray changes from red to yellow, and from yellow to
the most delicate blue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sails are flapping against the mast and the
ship rolls so gently that one might well suppose no
gale had ever ruffled this smooth summer ocean. To
see the sailors lolling on the watch, the observer
would infer they lead the idlest lives that mortals
could enjoy; but alas! such moments are like angel
visits with the crew. Poor fellows! How rich to
them is the delight of a single hour of freedom spent
in spinning their “tough yarns” under the lea of the
long-boat, in singing or in music! That clarionet is
admirably played, for rough and tarry fingers:—and
how softly the notes float on the damp night
air! The mate, in his impatience, is <span class='it'>whistling for a
wind</span>; and that “old salt,” in whom many years of
service have implanted deeply all the superstitions
of his class, is muttering to himself with discontented
glances, “You’ll have a cap-full, and more
than you want of it before long,—and in the wrong
quarter too.—I never knew any good to come of this
whistling for wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in truth, to judge from appearances, the prophecy
is likely, in this case, to be fulfilled. Already
the moon begins to be encircled by a wide halo of
vapor. It is almost imperceptible at present; but,
even while we speak, it gathers, and thickens, and
seems to become more palpable. Now it assumes
the faint tints of the lunar rain-bow; and all around
a silvery veil is falling over the face of the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slight fleeces of denser mist are collecting in columns
and squadrons across the sky, giving it a
mottled aspect. They are still too thin materially to
check the full-flooding of the moonlight; but, as
they gradually enlarge themselves, a slow, gliding
motion is perceived among them. They are wafted
gently southward; but the breeze—if breeze there be
to-night—will come from the opposite quarter; for the
higher and lower currents of our atmosphere are
almost invariably found thus at variance with each
other. The signs of the weather augur nothing favorable
to our success in speedily reaching the southern
trades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mark! How the broad glare of the moon-beams
on the water fades away as the vapors in the upper
air increase in density! The starlight reflection has
disappeared; and the bright little orb from which it
was derived, still struggling hard to make itself
conspicuous, shines on with fitful ray.—And now, it
is extinct.—Even the waters have lost their azure
hue, and all things above and below are rapidly becoming
gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swell is momentarily rising, though you discover
no cause for the change. Though we feel not
a puff of wind the sails flap less heavily against the
mast, and occasionally they are buoyed up and bellied
out for many seconds, as if lifted by the breath
of some unseen spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Listen to the voice of the waves!—For the sea
has a voice as well as the winds—not only where it
speaks in thunders, booming upon the level beach, or
roars among the time-worn rocks of an iron-bound
coast, but far off in its loneliness, also, where no barrier
opposes its will. Who knows not the mild tone
of the breeze of spring from the melancholy moan
of the autumnal gale?—As different is the dull plash
of the lazy billow in a settled calm from the threatening
sound that precedes a storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the steward is ringing his supper-bell. Let us
go below, and if I mistake not, you will find all nature
dressed in another garb when we return on
deck.</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>An hour has passed,—and what a change!—The
ship close hauled on a wind, no longer rolls listlessly
over the swell; but, laboring slowly up each coming
wave, she staggers and shivers from stem to stern, as
the crest of the watery mountain dashes against the
weather bow,—then, rushing down into the trough of
the sea and plunging deep into the succeeding billow,
she strains every shroud and back-stay with the sudden
jerk of the masts, and sends a broad sheet of
crackling foam to leeward from beneath the bows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How different is this disagreeable motion from
that which we enjoy when the wind is on the beam
or the quarter!—Then, we glide gently over the sea-hills,
and every wave seems playfully bent on urging
us forward:—Now, we are opposed unceasingly by
wind and swell, and must contest laboriously each
foot of the battle-ground, till the strength of our enemies
is exhausted—conscious the while, that every
league we loose in this strange, fitful region, may
cost us a week’s delay in the recovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is “a young gale” that bids fair to prove precocious;
for it is rapidly advancing towards maturity.
But it cannot last. Nothing but a calm displays
much tendency to permanence between the trades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavens are dark as midnight:—no star or
planet penetrates the gloom with a friendly ray:—yet
the color of the overhanging vault is by no
means uniform. Broad tracts or patches of intense
obscurity cover the chief part of the field of view;
but, at intervals, you may perceive long, moving,
dusky lines dividing these heavy masses, made visible
by a strange and unaccountable half illumination.
As they sweep hurriedly by, on their northward
course, seemingly almost within reach from
the mast head, we are made painfully conscious that
the wings of the tempest are hovering over us in
dangerous proximity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except the lamps in the binnacle, there is no obvious
source of light above or around us: yet the
outlines of the vessel, with all the labyrinth of spars
and rigging, are dimly traceable in the murky air.
Whence do we derive this power of vision? you
will naturally inquire.—A glance at the surface of
the water will explain it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every wave, as it combs and breaks, bears on its
summit a high crest of foam, visible at a great distance
by its own moonlight, or soft silvery radiation.
Each little ripple carries its tiny lantern. Wherever
the sea is disturbed by the motion of the vessel, and
especially at the bow, where the waters are rudely
disparted, or in the wake, where they rush together
violently as she shoots along, a gentle, milky light
is broadly diffused; and here and there a brilliant
spark is seen beneath the surface shining distinct and
permanent, like a star submerged, or gleaming and
disappearing alternately, like the fire-flies of June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The phosphorescence of the sea is unusually feeble
at present, but it is sufficient to prevent a total darkness,
and by its aid we trace the dim forms of surrounding
objects, while a slight reflection from the
clouds betrays the threatening aspect of the weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you observe those singular luminous appearances
resembling masses of pale fire, or torch lights,
hurrying from place to place, turning and meandering
in all directions, some feet beneath the waves, like
comets liberated from their proper spheres, and
wandering without rule in the abyss of waters?
They are produced by fish that are playing about
the vessel, and were we adepts in the sport we might
chance to strike one with the grains by the glare of
his own torch. But this requires the skill and long
experience of many voyages. To strike a fish by
day is difficult enough; for, even then, he is not to
be found where he appears. When you look obliquely
from the vessel’s side at any object in the
water, refraction changes its apparent place to a
much greater distance than the real one, and brings
the image nearer to the surface. Success in reaching
such an object requires your aim to be directed
towards a point considerably below the spot at
which your game is seen. At night the difficulty is
much enhanced;—for it is not the fish itself that emits
the light. The agitation produced by his rapid motions
awakens the thousands of luminous animalcules
swarming in every cubic foot of water, and, as they
fire their little tapers in succession, they fall into the
rear, while the fish darts onward under cover of the
obscurity, leaving a brilliant wake which serves but
to deceive, or sometimes to guide, his enemies, and
to attract his prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But hark!—How the wind howls through the
shrouds and whistles around the slender rigging!—The
gale increases, and another change comes over
the night scene. Do you observe how pitchy the
gloom has grown to windward?—All traces of the
clouds in that direction are lost.—Ha!—A flash of
lightning!—Here it comes in earnest!—The pouring
rain obscures even the phosphoric glimmering of the
waves, and now we have “night and storm and
darkness,” in all their terrible beauty! Who dares
attempt to paint the scene in words!—On every hand,—above—around—within—all
is confusion! The
crew spring to their stations, while the loud command
and the scarce audible response are mingled
with the dash of waves, the roar of the blast, and
the creaking of the wracked timbers in one discordant,
unintelligible burst of sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You stand, or rather <span class='it'>hang</span> by the mizzen shrouds,
the centre of an invisible world where the maddened
elements and hardy men contend for life or
conquest. You hear them, but you see them not,—save
when the electric flash tinges sea and cloud
with momentary brilliance. Your eye detects the
foot of the nearest mast, but you endeavor in vain
to trace the tall spar upwards towards the lofty perch
of those brave fellows on the yard, whose shrill
voices—heard as if from a mile in the distance, in
answer to the trumpet of the captain,—just reach
the ear amid the din of a thousand unearthly voices,
and add to the wizard wildness of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm swells loud and more loudly; but the
yielding ship has risen from the first awful impression
of its force and now careers furiously before it.
The brailed but unfurled topsails flap with a dull
and hollow thunder, as they whirl and rebound under
the restraint of the clue-lines and the iron hands of
the desperate crew. See that ghastly ball of purple
flame leaping from spar to spar, like the visible spirit
of the tempest!<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>—Now it is on the foremast
head,—now it glares on the bowsprit,—and again, it
springs to the mainyard and flashes full in the face
of you startled reefer, casting the hue of death over
his boyish features, rendered clearly visible for a
moment in the demon torchlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first flurry of the squall is passed;—we are
again on a wind!—but still wave follows wave, rolling
on with an angry roar;—and each in turn, as it
reaches the vessel, strikes the bow with a resounding
crash. Every plank in the firmly-bolted hull trembles
beneath the blow, while the billow sweeps off
under the lea, hissing and frothing in baffled rage to
find the gallant bark invulnerable to its power.—Ever
and anon the vivid lightning gilds the wide circle
of a boiling sea, covered with broad streaks of
foam driven onward for miles in narrow belts before
the wind, while the sharp, sudden thunder follows
on the instant, with a single detonation, like the
discharge of an enormous cannon. Here are no hills
and valleys to awake the long reverberating echoes—no
solid earth to fling back the war-note of the
storm in proud defiance to the clouds!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The binnacle lamps are shining on a portion of
the quarter-deck, and light up the form of the helmsman
at the wheel. Firm and unmoved amid the
elemental jar, he stands like a guardian spirit in the
centre of an illuminated sphere, contrasted so strongly
with the palpable darkness around, that the imponderable
air itself is made to appear material and tangible.
On him depends our fate. One error!—one
instance of momentary neglect, and the mountain
swell might overtop our oaken bulwarks, leaving us
a shattered and unmanagable wreck upon the desert
waste of waters!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But listen!—what mean those indescribable sounds
making themselves audible at intervals above the
roar of the gale? Look out into the gloom, and strive
to penetrate the mingled rain and spray!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you not see from time to time, those undefined
and monstrous shapes,—blacker than night itself,—rising
from the deep and giving utterance to noises
like the puff of a steam engine combined with the
snorting of some mammoth beast? Even here,
while winds and waves are raging—in this chaos of
air and ocean, where the barriers of heaven and
earth seem broken down, and spray and foam—the
sea—the rain—the clouds—are whirled together in
one wide mass of inextricable confusion—<span class='it'>even here</span>,
there are beings whose joy is in the tempest, sporting
their ungainly gambols—fearless of the scathing
bolt and glorying in the pealing thunder!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are surrounded by an army of the grampus
whales. Their breathing adds a fiend-like wildness
to the voices of the night,—and their dusky forms
looming through the obscurity as they thrust their
misshapen backs above the surface of the sea, give
an almost infernal aspect to the scene, <span class='it'>if scene that
may be called which is but half perceived</span> in dimness
that appears,</p>

<p class='pindent'>But come below!—We are happily exempt from
the necessity of dangerous exposure, and the force
of the salt spray that has been driven in our faces
with stinging effect for the last half hour begins to
weaken the impression of this magnificent display of
Omnipotence. Man would find room for selfishness
and vanity amid “the wreck of matter and the crush
of worlds.”—Your complexion is in danger! So if
you would avoid the hard looks of a weather-beaten
tar, it is time to seek the shelter of the cabin. There
I can amuse you with pictures of other night scenes
by sea and land, until this short-lived tropical squall
is over, or you feel inclined to retire to your state
room. In another hour we shall probably be bounding
along merrily, with all sail set, and the moon
beams sparkling and playing <span class='it'>hide-and-go-seek</span> among
the little rippling waves with which a six-knot breeze
roughens a subsiding swell!</p>

<p class='line0'>The eye is open, with convulsive strain⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A most unfleshly orb! the stars that wane</p>
<p class='line0'>Have nothing of its hue; for it is cast</p>

<p class='line0'>In elfin tresses, sadly murmuring.</p>
<p class='line0'>The worm hath ’gan to crawl upon her brow⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The living worm! and with a ripple now,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like that upon the sea, are heard below</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And ever and anon a yellow group</p>
<p class='line0'>Was creeping on her bosom, like a troop</p>
<p class='line0'>Of stars, far up amid the galaxy,</p>
<p class='line0'>Pale, pale, as snowy showers, and two or three</p>
<p class='line0'>Were mocking the cold finger, round and round</p>
<p class='line0'>With likeness of a ring; and, as they wound</p>
<p class='line0'>About its bony girth, they had the hue</p>
<p class='line0'>Of pearly jewels glistening in the dew.</p>
<p class='line0'>That deathly stare! it is an awful thing</p>
<p class='line0'>To gaze upon; and sickly thoughts will spring</p>
<p class='line0'>Before it to the heart: it telleth how</p>
<p class='line0'>There must be waste where there is beauty now.</p>
<p class='line0'>The chalk! the chalk! where was the virgin snow</p>
<p class='line0'>Of that once heaving bosom? even so,</p>
<p class='line0'>The cold, pale dewy chalk, with yellow shade</p>
<p class='line0'>Amid the leprous hues; and o’er it play’d</p>
<p class='line0'>The straggling moonlight and the merry breeze,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like two fair elves that by the murmuring seas</p>
<p class='line0'>Woo’d smilingly together; but there fell</p>
<p class='line0'>No life-gleam on the brow, all terrible</p>

<p class='line0'>All gorgeous and all glorious before;</p>
<p class='line0'>For waste, like to the wanton night, was o’er</p>

<p class='line0'>And he hath lifted water in a clam</p>
<p class='line0'>And tasted sweetly from a stream that swam</p>
<p class='line0'>Down to the sea; and now is turn’d away</p>
<p class='line0'>Again, again, to gaze on Agathè!</p>
<p class='line0'>There is a cave upon that isle—a cave</p>
<p class='line0'>Where dwelt a hermit-man: the winter wave</p>
<p class='line0'>Roll’d to its entrance, casting a bright mound</p>
<p class='line0'>Of snowy shells and fairy pebbles round;</p>
<p class='line0'>And over were the solemn ridges strewn</p>
<p class='line0'>Of a dark rock, that, like the wizard throne</p>
<p class='line0'>Of some sea-monarch, stood, and from it hung</p>
<p class='line0'>Wild thorn and bramble in confusion flung</p>
<p class='line0'>Amid the startling crevices—like sky</p>
<p class='line0'>Through gloom of clouds, that sweep in thunder by.</p>
<p class='line0'>A cataract fell over, in a streak</p>
<p class='line0'>Of silver, playing many a wanton freak;</p>
<p class='line0'>Midway, and musical, with elfin glee</p>
<p class='line0'>It bounded in its beauty to the sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like dazzling angel vanishing away.</p>
<p class='line0'>In sooth, ’twas pleasant in the moonlight gray</p>
<p class='line0'>To see that fairy fountain leaping so,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like one that knew not wickedness nor woe!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The hermit had his cross and rosary:</p>
<p class='line0'>I ween like other hermits so was he,</p>
<p class='line0'>A holy man and frugal, and at night</p>
<p class='line0'>He prayed, or slept, or, sometimes, by the light</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the fair moon went wandering beside</p>
<p class='line0'>The lonely sea, to hear the silver tide</p>
<p class='line0'>Rolling in gleesome music to the shore;</p>
<p class='line0'>The more he heard he loved to hear the more.</p>
<p class='line0'>And there he is, his hoary beard adrift</p>

<p class='line0'>Both blending into one ethereal glow:</p>
<p class='line0'>And the same breathing radiancy, that swam</p>

<p class='line0'>All rampant, like great lions terribly,</p>
<p class='line0'>And gnashing on each other: and anon,</p>
<p class='line0'>Julio heard them, rushing one by one,</p>
<p class='line0'>And laugh’d and turn’d. The hermit was away</p>
<p class='line0'>For he was old and weary, and he lay</p>
<p class='line0'>Within his cave, and thought it was a dream,</p>
<p class='line0'>A summer’s dream! and so the quiet stream</p>
<p class='line0'>Of sleep came o’er his eyelids, and in truth</p>
<p class='line0'>He dreamt of that strange ladye and the youth</p>
<p class='line0'>That held a death-wake on her wasting form;</p>
<p class='line0'>And so he slept and woke not till the storm</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But they came—the wind, and sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>And rain and thunder, that in giant glee,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sang o’er the lightnings pale, as to and fro</p>
<p class='line0'>They writhed, like stricken angels!—white as snow</p>
<p class='line0'>Roll’d billow after billow, and the tide</p>
<p class='line0'>Came forward as an army deep and wide,</p>
<p class='line0'>To charge with all its waters. There was heard</p>
<p class='line0'>A murmur far and far, of those that stirr’d</p>
<p class='line0'>Within the great encampment of the sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dark they were, and lifted terribly</p>
<p class='line0'>Their water-spouts like banners. It was grand</p>
<p class='line0'>To see the black battalions, hand in hand</p>
<p class='line0'>Striding to conflict, and their helmets bent</p>
<p class='line0'>Below their foamy plumes magnificent!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And Julio heard and laugh’d. “Shall I be king</p>
<p class='line0'>To your great hosts, that ye are murmuring</p>
<p class='line0'>For one to bear you to your holy war?</p>
<p class='line0'>There is no sun, or moon, or any star,</p>
<p class='line0'>To guide your iron footsteps as ye go,</p>
<p class='line0'>But I, your king, will marshal you to flow</p>
<p class='line0'>From shore to shore. Then bring my car of shell,</p>
<p class='line0'>That I may ride before you terrible;</p>
<p class='line0'>And bring my sceptre of the amber weed,</p>
<p class='line0'>And Agathè, my virgin bride, shall lead</p>
<p class='line0'>Your summer hosts, when these are ambling low,</p>
<p class='line0'>In azure and in ermine, to and fro.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He said, and madly, with his wasted hand</p>
<p class='line0'>Swept o’er the tuneless harp, and fast he spanned</p>
<p class='line0'>The silver chords, until a rush of sound</p>
<p class='line0'>Came from them, solemn—terrible—profound;</p>
<p class='line0'>And then he dash’d the instrument away</p>
<p class='line0'>Into the waters, and the giant play</p>
<p class='line0'>Of billows threw it back unto the shore,</p>
<p class='line0'>A shiver’d, stringless frame—its day of music o’er!</p>
<p class='line0'>The tide, the rolling tide! the multitude</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the sea surges, terrible and rude,</p>
<p class='line0'>Tossing their chalky foam along the bed</p>
<p class='line0'>Of thundering pebbles, that are shoring dread.</p>
<p class='line0'>And fast retreating to the gloomy gorge</p>
<p class='line0'>Of waters, sounding like a Titan forge!</p>
<p class='line0'>It comes! it comes! the tide, the rolling tide!</p>
<p class='line0'>But Julio is bending to his bride,</p>
<p class='line0'>And making mirthful whispers to her ear,</p>
<p class='line0'>A cataract! a cataract is near,</p>
<p class='line0'>Of one stupendous billow, and it breaks</p>
<p class='line0'>Terribly furious, with a myriad flakes</p>
<p class='line0'>Of foam, that fly about the haggard twain;</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio started, with a sudden pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>That shot into his heart; his reason flew</p>
<p class='line0'>Back to her throne: he rose, and wildly threw</p>
<p class='line0'>His matted tresses over on his brow.</p>
<p class='line0'>Another billow came, and even now</p>
<p class='line0'>Was dashing at his feet. There was no shade</p>
<p class='line0'>Of terror, as the serpent waters play’d</p>
<p class='line0'>Before him, but his eye was calm as death.</p>
<p class='line0'>Another, yet another! and the breath</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the weird wind was with it, like a rock</p>
<p class='line0'>Unriveted it fell—a shroud of smoke</p>
<p class='line0'>Pass’d over—there was heard, and died away,</p>
<p class='line0'>The voice of one shrill-shrieking “Agathè!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The sea-bird sitteth lonely by the side</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the far waste of waters, flapping wide</p>
<p class='line0'>His wet and weary wings; but he is gone,</p>
<p class='line0'>The stricken Julio! a wave-swept stone</p>
<p class='line0'>Stands there, on which he sat, and nakedly</p>
<p class='line0'>It rises looking to the lonely sea;</p>
<p class='line0'>But Julio is gone, and Agathè!</p>
<p class='line0'>The waters swept them madly to their core⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The dead and living with a frantic roar!</p>
<p class='line0'>And so he died, his bosom fondly set</p>
<p class='line0'>On hers; and round her clay-cold waist were met</p>
<p class='line0'>His bare and wither’d arms, and to her brow</p>
<p class='line0'>His lips were press’d. Both, both are perish’d now!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He died upon her bosom in a swoon:</p>
<p class='line0'>And fancied of the pale and silver moon,</p>
<p class='line0'>That went before him in her hall of blue;</p>
<p class='line0'>He died like golden insect in the dew,</p>
<p class='line0'>Calm, calm and pure; and not a chord was wrung</p>
<p class='line0'>In his deep heart—but love. He perish’d young,</p>
<p class='line0'>But perish’d wasted by some fatal flame</p>
<p class='line0'>That fed upon his vitals: and there came</p>
<p class='line0'>Lunacy, sweeping lightly, like a stream,</p>
<p class='line0'>Along his brain—he perish’d in a dream!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In sooth I marvel not</p>
<p class='line0'>If death be only a mysterious thought,</p>
<p class='line0'>That cometh on the heart and turns the brow</p>
<p class='line0'>Brightless and chill, as Julio’s is now;</p>
<p class='line0'>For only had the wasting struggle been</p>
<p class='line0'>Of one wild feeling, till it rose within</p>
<p class='line0'>Into the form of death, and nature felt</p>
<p class='line0'>The light of the immortal being melt</p>
<p class='line0'>Into its happier home beyond the sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>And moon, and stars, into eternity!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The sun broke through his dungeon, long enthrall’d</p>
<p class='line0'>By dismal clouds, and on the emerald</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the great living sea was blazing down</p>
<p class='line0'>To gift the lordly billows with a crown</p>
<p class='line0'>Of diamond and silver. From his cave</p>
<p class='line0'>The hermit came, and by the dying wave</p>
<p class='line0'>Lone wander’d, and he found upon the sand,</p>
<p class='line0'>Below a truss of sea-weed, with his hand</p>
<p class='line0'>Around the silent waist of Agathè</p>
<p class='line0'>The corse of Julio! Pale, pale, it lay</p>
<p class='line0'>Beside the wasted girl. The fireless eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Was open, and a jewell’d rosary</p>
<p class='line0'>Flung round the neck; but it was gone—the cross</p>
<p class='line0'>That Agathè had given.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='line0'>The hermit scoop’d a solitary grave</p>
<p class='line0'>Below the pine-trees, and he sang a stave,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or two, or three, of some old requiem</p>
<p class='line0'>As in their narrow home he buried them;</p>
<p class='line0'>And many a day before that blessed spot</p>
<p class='line0'>He sate, in lone and melancholy thought,</p>
<p class='line0'>Gazing upon the grave; and one had guess’d</p>
<p class='line0'>Of some dark secret shadowing his breast.</p>
<p class='line0'>And yet, to see him, with his silver hair</p>
<p class='line0'>Adrift and floating in the sea-borne air,</p>
<p class='line0'>And features chasten’d in the tears of woe,</p>
<p class='line0'>In sooth, ’twas merely sad to see him so!</p>
<p class='line0'>A wreck of nature floating far and fast,</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon the stream of Time—to sink at last!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And he is wandering by the shore again,</p>
<p class='line0'>Hard leaning on his staff; the azure main</p>
<p class='line0'>Lies sleeping far before him, with his seas</p>
<p class='line0'>Fast folded in the bosom of the breeze,</p>
<p class='line0'>That like the angel Peace, hath dropt his wings</p>
<p class='line0'>Around the warring waters. Sadly sings</p>
<p class='line0'>To his own heart that lonely hermit-man,</p>
<p class='line0'>A tale of other days when passion ran</p>
<p class='line0'>Along his pulses like a troubled stream,</p>
<p class='line0'>And glory was a splendor and a dream!</p>
<p class='line0'>He stoop’d to gather up a shining gem</p>
<p class='line0'>That lay amid the shells, as bright as them,</p>
<p class='line0'>It was a cross, the cross that Agathè</p>
<p class='line0'>Had given to her Julio; the play</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the fierce sunbeams fell upon its face,</p>
<p class='line0'>And on the glistening jewels—but the trace</p>
<p class='line0'>Of some old thought came burning to the brain</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the pale hermit, and he shrunk in pain</p>
<p class='line0'>Before the holy symbol. It was not</p>
<p class='line0'>Because of the eternal ransom wrought</p>
<p class='line0'>In ages far away, or he had bent</p>
<p class='line0'>In pure devotion, sad and reverent;</p>
<p class='line0'>But now, he startled as he look’d upon</p>
<p class='line0'>That jewell’d thing, and wildly he is gone</p>
<p class='line0'>Back to the mossy grave, away, away:</p>
<p class='line0'>“My child, my child! my own, own Agathè!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It is her father,—he,—an alter’d man!</p>
<p class='line0'>His quiet had been wounded, and the ban</p>
<p class='line0'>Of misery came over him, and froze</p>
<p class='line0'>The bright and holy tides, that fell and rose</p>
<p class='line0'>In joy amid his heart. To think of her,</p>
<p class='line0'>That he had injured so, and all so fair,</p>
<p class='line0'>So fond, so like the chosen of his youth,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>It was a very dismal thought, in truth,</p>
<p class='line0'>That he had left her hopelessly, for aye,</p>
<p class='line0'>Within the cloister-wall to droop, and die!</p>
<p class='line0'>And so he could not bear to have it be;</p>
<p class='line0'>But sought for some lone island in the sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where he might dwell in doleful solitude,</p>
<p class='line0'>And do strange penance in his mirthful mood,</p>
<p class='line0'>For this same crime, unnaturally wild,</p>
<p class='line0'>That he had done unto his saintly child.</p>
<p class='line0'>And ever he did think, when he had laid</p>
<p class='line0'>These lovers in the grave, that, through the shade</p>
<p class='line0'>Of ghostly features melting to decay,</p>
<p class='line0'>He saw the image of his Agathè.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And now the truth had flash’d into his brain:</p>

<div><h1><a id='eve'></a>ST. AGNES’ EVE.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A CHIT-CHAT ABOUT KEATS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>God bless you, Oliver, don’t think of such a thing!
<span class='it'>I</span> join the temperance society!—why, you old curmudgeon,
would you murder me outright? Not that
temperance societies haven’t done good—many a
poor wife and weeping mother have they made happy—but,
then, ever since I read Anacreon at college
and shot buffalos at the Black Hills, I’ve had a fellow
feeling for the good things of this life, especially for
beef-steaks and port wine. I’m an Epicurean, sir—you
needn’t talk to me of glory—I despise the whole
cant about posthumous renown. The great end of
life is happiness, and happiness is best secured by
gratifying our physical as well as our intellectual
nature. I go in, sir, for enjoying existence, and
when I was in my prime, I flatter myself that few
could beat me at a dinner or had a more delicate
way of making love to the girls. But alas! we have
fallen on troublous times. The wine of these days—I
say it with tears in my eyes—isn’t the wine of my
youth; and the girls—here’s a health to the sweet
angels—have sadly deteriorated from what their
grandmothers were. <span class='it'>Eheu! Eheu!</span> The world is
getting upside down, and I shouldn’t wonder if an
earthquake or epidemic or some other calamity
should overtake us yet to fill up the catalogue of our
ills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have just been reading Keats—shame on the
wretches who tortured him to death! He is a practical
argument, sir, for my creed. Genius he had
unquestionably, yet he never enjoyed a happy hour.
Why was this? Born in humble life, he thirsted for
distinction, and trusting to his genius to achieve renown,
found himself assailed by hostile critics, who
dragged his private life before the public eye, and
sneered at his poetry with the bitter scorn of fiends.
He was naturally of a delicate constitution—of a
proud and aspiring character; but of a modesty as
shrinking as the sensitive plant; and when he found
himself slighted, abused, maligned—when he saw
that he was thrust back at every attempt to elevate
himself, his delicate nature gave way, and he died of
a broken heart, requesting that his epitaph might be,
“Here lies one whose name was writ on water.”
The world, since then, has done tardy justice to his
genius—but this did not soothe his sorrows, nor will
it reach him in his silent grave. What to him is
posthumous renown?—what the tears of this generation
or the plaudits of the next? Had he been less
sensitive, had he thirsted less after glory, he might
still have been living, with matured powers, extorting
even from his enemies deserved commendation. But
he fell in his youthful prime, an eaglet pierced before
it had learnt to soar. I have shed tears over his
grave at Rome—let us drink to his memory in solemn
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keats would have made a giant had he lived, sir.
Everything he wrote evinced high genius. Each
successive poem he published displayed increased
merit. His sonnets remind me of Milton—his shorter
pieces breathe of Lycidas or Venus and Adonis. He
had little artistical skill, but then what an exuberant
fancy! Few men had a finer perception of the
beautiful, the το καλον of poetry. He is one of the most
Grecian—if I may use the expression—of our poets.
Shelley, perhaps, was more deeply imbued with the
Attic spirit, but then, although his heart was always
right, his intellect was always wrong, and thus
it happens that his poetry is often mystic, obscure,
and even confused. Keats was not so. He had this
freshness without its mysticism. He delighted in
themes drawn from classic fountains, in allusions
breathing of Thessaly and the gods. There was in
many of his poems a voluptuousness approaching to
effeminacy, reminding one of the Aphrodite in her
own fragrant bowers. In others of his poems there
was an Arcadian sweetness. What is finer than his
ode to the Grecian Urn? Do you remember the
opening?</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Thou still unravished bride of quietness!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delicious, is it not? You seem to be in classic
Greece itself, amid the groves of Academus, by the
fountain of Castaly, beneath the god-encircled Olympus.
You can hear the Dorian flutes, you can see the
daughters of Ionia. There are the priest and his
assistants leading the flower-decked heifer to the
altar—lo! a group of bacchantes singing and dancing
through the vale. And high up yonder is the snowy
temple of Jove—a picture for the gods!</p>

<p class='pindent'>You shake your head—you have no taste for classic
allusions. Egad! I remember, you are a devotee
of the German literature, and admire nothing which
is not of the romantic school, Well, well—have you
ever read “The Eve of St. Agnes?” It is—let me
tell you—the poem for which Keats will be loved,
and you ought to walk barefooted a thousand miles,
like an ancient pilgrim to Loretto, for having neglected
to peruse this poem. It is not so fine as Hyperion,
but then the latter is a fragment. It is as superior
to Endymion as a star to a satellite. It pleases
me more than Lamia or Isabella. It has the glow of
a landscape seen through a rosy glass—it is warm
and blushing, yet pure as a maiden in her first exceeding
beauty. As Burgundy is to other wines, as
a bride blushing to her lover’s side is to other virgins,
so is “The Eve of St. Agnes” to other poems.
What luxuriance of fancy, what scope of language,
what graphic power it displays! It is a love story,
and right witchingly told. How exquisite the description
of Madeline, her moonlit chamber, her
awakening from her dream, and the delicious intoxicating
emotions which break on her when she learns
that she loves and is beloved. Ah! sir, we are old
now, but I never read this poem without thinking of
the time when I first pressed my own Mary to my
side, and felt her little warm heart beating against
my own. Egad, I will just skip over “The Eve of
St. Agnes,” to pass the time away while we finish
this bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poem opens with a graphic picture of a winter’s
night. Draw closer to the grate, for—by my
ancestry!—it is a freezing theme. I will read.</p>

<p class='line0'>The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;</p>
<p class='line0'>The hare limp’d trembling through the frozen grass,</p>
<p class='line0'>And silent was the flock in woolly fold:</p>
<p class='line0'>Numb were the Beadsman’s fingers, while he told</p>
<p class='line0'>His rosary, and while his frosted breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like pious incense from a censer old,</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poet then proceeds to describe a festive scene,
amid which is one fair lady, whose heart had
throbbed all day on love, she having heard old dames
tell that maidens might, on St. Agnes’ eve, behold
their lovers in dreams, if they observed certain mystic
ceremonies. The lovely Madeline has resolved
to follow the old legend, and she sighs, amid her
suitors, for midnight to arrive. Then goes the story
thus:</p>

<p class='line0'>For Madeline. Beside the portal doors,</p>
<p class='line0'>Buttress’d from moonlight, stands he, and implores</p>
<p class='line0'>All saints to give him sight of Madeline,</p>

young Porphyro has but one friend, an old beldame,

line. While watching thus, the beldame discovers
him and beseeches him to fly. He refuses. In her
garrulous entreaty she reveals to Porphyro that his
mistress intends playing the conjurer to discover who
shall be her lover. He eagerly makes a proposition,
to which the old dame objects in horror, but after
many protestations on his part and a rash declaration
that otherwise he will reveal himself to his foes, she
finally consents. And what was his proposition? Let

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed,</p>
<p class='line0'>But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In sort of wakeful swoon, perplex’d she lay,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress’d</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Blissfully haven’d both from joy and pain;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Clasp’d like a missal where swart Paynims pray,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain,</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, when the maiden is all asleep, her
lover steals from his hiding place, and mixing a
charm, kneels by her bedside, and while his warm
unnerved arm sinks in her pillow, he whispers to her
that he is her eremite, and beseeches her for sweet
Agnes’ sake to open her eyes. But the maiden, lying
there in her holy sleep, awakes not. At length he
takes her lute, and kneeling by her ear, plays an ancient
ditty. She utters a soft moan. He ceases—she
pants quick—and suddenly her blue eyes open in
affright, while her lover sinks again on his knees,
pale as a sculptured statue. And Madeline awakening,
and thinking that her blissful dream is over,
begins to weep. At length she finds vent for her
words, and are they not sweet as the complainings
of a dove?</p>

your eyes, and fancy you see the lover kneeling by
the bedside of that white-armed one, fragrant and
pure as a lily in the overshadowed brook—lovelier
than an Imogen, whose very breath perfumes the
chamber. Hear her low complainings when she fancies
that her lover is about to desert her. Are they
not more musical than the zephyrs sighing through
the moonlit pines? And then how soothing is Porphyro,
and how delicately he allays her fears. Ah!
the moon is down, and the chamber is in darkness—and
there, as I live, the rain-drops are pattering

<p class='pindent'>Who, after that, will say that Keats was not a genius?
But “Hyperion,” though less complete than
this poem, evinces—let me tell you—even more of
the “<span class='it'>mens divinior</span>.” “The Eve of St. Agnes” is
warm, voluptuous, luxuriant, yet pure as a quiet
pool with silver sand below—but “Hyperion” is bold,
impassioned and colossal, Miltonic even in its grandeur,
overpowering at times as a thunder-storm
among the mountains. Would God that Keats had
lived to finish it! With many faults, it evinces more
genius than any poem since written in our language.
Hear the speeches of the Titans!—read the description
of Apollo!—drink in the intoxication of its less
sublime but more beautiful passages! It often exhibits
a redundant fancy—the style is at times affected,
and the choice of words bad—the execution
is careless, though less so than that of Endymion—and,
above all, the plan of the poem, so far as it has
been developed, bears an unhappy resemblance to
Milton’s Paradise Lost. Yet it displays such extraordinary
genius, that we will never forgive the
Quarterly for having disheartened Keats from the
completion of this poem. Ah! sir, what has the
world lost?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I repeat it, I am an Epicurean. Fame!—immortality!—what
are they? We wear out our lives for
a bauble, and coin our souls away to purchase dross.
We dig our own graves and call it <span style='font-size:smaller'>GLORY</span>. Away
with such sophistry! Go over the melancholy list of
unfortunate genius—White, Collins, Keats, Chatterton
and the rest—and tell me what they reaped except
thorns! Ah! sir, it melts my heart with pity—I
must take a glass on it. But, I declare, the bottle’s

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EPES SARGEANT.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is very questionable whether the reader has
ever heard a true and impartial account of the affair
at Tattletown. So many exaggerated versions have
been put forth—so many garbled and malicious reports
in regard to it, have been propagated—that the
world is likely to be either unduly prejudiced against
one of the parties, or wholly in doubt as to the merits
of both. It is with an emotion of pride, that I take
up my pen with the consciousness of being able to
throw light upon this interesting, but mysterious
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There have been many changes in Tattletown
during the last twenty years. Of this fact I became
assured the last summer, when, by the way of a parenthesis
in a tour to the White Hills, I branched off
from my prescribed route to visit the little village
where I had spent so many pleasant days in boyhood.
What a change! It used to be one of the quietest,
greenest, most sequestered nooks in the world, with
its single wide street, bordered by venerable elms,
and its shady by-roads radiating in every direction,
and dotted with white cottages embosomed in clouds
of verdure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then its inn! its single, unpretending inn,
with its simple flag-staff, its modest piazza, and its
cool, clean parlor, with the vase of asparagus upon
the freshly reddened hearth-stone! Its sleeping-rooms
with their snow-white curtains and coverlets, and
the rustling foliage against their windows—what a
temptation it was to enter them of a warm summer
afternoon! Now, forsooth, the respectable old tenement
is replaced by a hotel. I beg pardon—a <span class='it'>house</span>,
built after the style of the Parthenon, its sides painted
very white, and its blinds very green. The bar-room
is floored with tesselated squares of marble,
and there is a white marble counter, behind which
presides a spruce young man with long dark hair
plastered over his right ear, and an emerald breast-pin
on his shirt bosom. Nay, it is rumored that the
landlord has serious designs of introducing a gong in
the place of the good old-fashioned bell of our forefathers.
What is the country coming to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within my remembrance, the people of Tattletown
were the best natured, most industrious and contented
people alive. Every evening in summer their patriarchs
might be seen sitting in front of their woodbine-covered
porches, smoking their pipes and talking over
old times, while groups of ruddy, riotous children,
flaxen-haired and blue-eyed, danced to the strains of
some village Paganini. Poor, deluded, miserable
Tattletonians! What a sight was it for the philanthropist
to grieve at! Little knew they, of the
errors and vices of the social system! They had not
read Miss Martineau’s tracts; knew nothing of Owenism,
nothing of Grahamism, nothing of transcendentalism,
nothing of Fourierism, nothing of Mormonism.
The “Society for the promotion of every thing,” had
not established a branch among them. They were
benighted, uninitiated; contented to live as their
fathers had lived before them; to pluck the rose and
leave the thorn behind; to keep their linen and their
consciences clean, and to remain at peace with all
mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the belles of the village—how beautiful they
were! how artless! how adorned with every sylvan
grace! Now they all seem to have lost the heritage
of loveliness. They look didactic, sedentary and
precocious. There is not the same bloom on the
cheek—the same sparkle in the eye—the same ruby
mischief on the lip. Instead of cultivating their
music and their flower-gardens, working flags for the
Tattletown “Guardians of Liberty,” and teaching
the children their catechisms on Sundays, they are
meddling with matters that they have not the means
of comprehending, establishing <span class='it'>anti-everything</span> societies,
and fussing over phrenology and other newfangled
heresies. Instead of a vase of freshly gathered
flowers upon their shelves, you are now greeted
by a vile plaster bust, with the skull phrenologically
mapped out, and figured. I never encounter one of
the odious things, without putting my fist in its face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A religious revolution has, of course, been introduced
among the other mutations. Instead of one
well-filled church, where all the villagers may meet
as members of one family, Tattletown can now boast
of half a dozen sectarian societies, which are eternally
at war with one another. Poor old Dr. Balmwell,
who is still the meekest of God’s creatures, and
whose annual salary would not equal the one night’s
wages of a second-rate theatrical star, is denounced
as a “haughty, over-fed prelate,” “the advocate of
an established church,” and a “vile minion of the
aristocracy.” Many a fair maiden is content to go
with holes in her stockings, in order that she may
contribute to the “society for the support of indigent
young men intended for the ministry!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As for politics—but here I approach the subject
which was uppermost in my mind at starting. All
the world knows that there are, or rather used to be,
two rival newspapers published at Tattletown, the
editors of which manage to keep the poor people in
a perpetual ferment. There is the Tattletown Independent
American, edited by Mr. Snobb! and the
Tattletown <span class='it'>Free</span> and Independent American, edited
by Mr. Fobb. The former is the longer established
of the two, and, as the public are well aware, is conservative
in its tone. Fobb’s hebdomadal, on the
contrary, is characterised by the spirit of innovation.
If a doctrine be new, startling, incredible, abrupt,
violating all preconceived notions and prejudices, it
commends itself at once to Fobb’s acceptance. He
will urge it with a boldness and pertinacity that confound
the unthinking. To incur his opposition, it is
only necessary that a principle should be old and well
established. His morality would seem to resemble
that of the tribe, with whom it is a custom to kill all
their old men and women. Age is with him the
worst of crimes, and the most penal. Novelty is the
first of charms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange as it may seem, Fobb has his devoted admirers
and active supporters. As for Snobb, I am
credibly informed, that, disgusted with the supineness
of the Tattletonians, he had at one time resolved to
relinquish the publication of the “Independent American,”
when, unexpectedly, the field was invaded by
Fobb with his “Free and Independent.” Then it
was that the patriotism and disinterestedness of
Snobb’s character shone conspicuous. He was, to
use his own vigorous expression, determined to
stand to his guns, and however great might be the
pecuniary sacrifice, to remain in the village to combat
the pernicious influence, which, “like the Bohon
Upas,” I quote Snobb’s own words—“would spread
poison and desolation among families and communities.”
Snobb wound off his appeal, by calling upon
all, who valued their liberty and their lives; who
would save their country from intestine confusion
and slaughter; who would keep unstained the altar
of domestic felicity, and transmit unimpaired that
glorious fabric of constitutional right, cemented by
the blood of martyred ancestors—to rally round him
and the Independent American. “Any person obtaining
five subscribers,” said he in conclusion, “shall
receive a sixth copy gratis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to conceive of the degree of excitement
produced in Tattletown by this fulmination, on
the part of Snobb, and the subsequent establishment
of the “Free and Independent American,” on the
part of Fobb. Such a thing as neutrality could no
longer exist. Great and vital principles were at stake;
and from the squire to the tinman’s apprentice, it was
necessary that every man should take one side or the
other—should be either a Snobbite or a Fobbite.
Both journals were benefited by this agitation. New
subscribers poured in daily, and a fund was raised by
the partisans of each establishment for the more
effectual prosecution of the war. And what was the
war about? To this day nobody can tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Personalities now began to be interchanged. Snobb
gave Fobb the lie direct, and defied him to prove a
statement which had appeared in the “Free and Independent,”
accusing Snobb of highway robbery,
arson and other little peccadilloes. Fobb treated
Snobb’s defiance with an easy irony, which bewildered
the good people of Tattletown, who began to
think that Fobb must know a good deal more of Snobb
than other people. The following answer appeared
in the “Independent American:”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must apologise to our readers for again polluting
our columns with an allusion to the reckless
traducer, whose journal of yesterday came forth
reeking with slanders against ourselves. It would
be charitable, perhaps, to attribute to a diseased intellect,
rather than a malicious temper, these ebullitions
of mendacity, but the motive is too obviously
bad. We can assure this poor creature, this beggarly
reprobate and unwashed scribbler, that mere declamation
is not proof, and that assertion carries no
weight when unsustained by evidence. If he can
keep sober long enough, let him reply to the question
which we once more reiterate, ‘where are your
proofs?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with intense anxiety that the citizens of
Tattletown looked for the next number of the “Free
and Independent.” Never before had Snobb been so
severe, so savage. Fobb’s rejoinder excited public
interest in the quarrel, to a painful degree. It was
as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The guilty fugitive from justice, whom it is with
shame we acknowledge as our contemporary, attempts
to invalidate our charges by clamoring for
proofs. We beg him to reflect a moment before he
repeats his call. If he has sincerely striven to make
reparation for past misdemeanors, by a life comparatively
guiltless—if there be any hope or prospect of
reformation in his case—most reluctantly would we
be instrumental in re-consigning him to the States-prison
or the gallows. Before, therefore, we come
out with any statements, that shall be universally admitted
as final and conclusive as to the character of
this man, we will put a few questions which he will
understand, however enigmatical they may be to
others. Did Snobb ever make the acquaintance of
Miss Amanda W——? Did he ever see a white crape
scarf that used to belong to that ill-fated young lady?
Does he remember the circumstance of an old
pruning-knife being found beneath a cherry-tree?
Has he still got <span class='it'>that red silk hankerchief</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must leave it for some more graphic pen—to the
author of “Jack Sheppard” or “Barnaby Rudge,”
to depict the consternation and horror produced
among the Tattletonians by this publication. Could it
be that Tattletown harbored a murderer? What other
interpretation could be put upon the diabolical insinuations
in Fobb’s paper? For a week and more nothing
was talked of but this article. At the post
office—the tinman’s shop—the grocer’s—on the steps
of the meeting-houses, no other topic was broached.
With unprecedented eagerness the next number of
Snobb’s paper was looked for and purchased. The
only allusion it contained to Fobb’s ferocious attack
was in these simple lines: “As we shall make the
insinuations contained in the last number of the Tattletown
Free and Independent the subject of a judicial
investigation, it is quite unnecessary for us to
bestow any farther notice upon the miserable calumniator,
who is striving to get into notice by means
of the attention he may provoke from ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tattletown was disappointed in this rejoinder, and
began to entertain its suspicions as to the truth of
Fobb’s intimations. The old women of the place
began to shake their heads and look wise, when the
subject was broached. “They <span class='it'>must</span> say they always
thought there was something wrong—something not
altogether <span class='it'>easy</span> about Mr. Snobb. They hoped for
the best, but there <span class='it'>were</span> things—however murder
will out.” The fate of the injured “Amanda” was
a topic of endless speculation among the more youthful
of the feminine inhabitants; and there was a
delightful mystery about the “white crape scarf,”
which afforded an exhaustless pabulum for curiosity.
Snobb must certainly clear up his character. He
must explain the circumstances in regard to that
“ill-fated young lady.” He must tell the public
what became of “that red silk handkerchief.”
Above all, he must satisfactorily account for the horrible
fact of the old pruning-knife being found under
the cherry-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Fobb declared that he was daily
and hourly environed with the perils of assassination.
He was obliged to go armed, to protect himself from
the minions of the culprit Snobb. His fearless devotion
to the cause of truth and justice had “sharpened
daggers that were thirsting for his blood—but
what was life compared with the proud satisfaction
of having maintained the cause of the people,</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of the excitement produced by this
war of words, Tattletown was electrified one fine
morning in December, by the report, that Snobb and
Fobb had gone over to the neighboring village of
Bungville to settle their differences by mortal combat.
Two spruce young men from New York had arrived
in the stage-coach the night before, and put up at
the Tattletown house. <span class='it'>They had brought guns with
them</span>; and early that morning the two editors, similarly
armed and equipped, had started off with the
strangers in a wagon belonging to the latter, in the
direction of the village already named. As these
facts became currently known among the Tattletonians
the sensation was prodigious. A meeting of
the “select men” was instantly called, and a committee
of five, consisting of Mr. Fuzz, the retired “squire
of the village,” Mr. Rattle, the tinman, Mr. Ponder,
the celebrated lecturer on matters and things in general,
Mr. Rumble the auctioneer, and Mr. Blister
the apothecary, were appointed to proceed on horseback
to Bungville, and prevent if possible the duel—or,
if that had transpired, to arrest the survivor and
the seconds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Headed by Mr. Fuzz, the cavalcade started off in
gallant style, followed by the prayers and anxious
entreaties of the gentler sex to prevent if possible
the “effusion of blood.” Miss Celestina Scragg, the
poetess of the village, and the author of the celebrated
ode to that beautiful stream, the Squamkeog,
came very near being thrown under the hoofs of the
squire’s horse, as she appealed to Mr. Fuzz, and
besought him to rescue Albert, as she tenderly designated
Mr. Fobb, or “perish in the attempt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After riding hard for about an hour, the committee
approached the Bungville house, where they determined
to make their first inquiries as to the fate of
the editors and their seconds. Mr. Buzz, the landlord,
was a brisk, officious little man, who always
knew before you spoke what you were going to say,
and rarely listened to more than the two first words
of any question you might put to him. He was,
moreover, a little deaf, so that the habit of anticipation
was, perhaps, as much a matter of necessity as
of choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we arrived too late?” asked Fuzz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by more than an hour. It is all over,” replied
Buzz, who supposed that the inquiry had reference
to the dinner hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all over, gentlemen,” said Fuzz, in a magisterial
tone, turning to his awe-stricken companions.
“Has any one been killed or wounded?” continued
he, addressing the landlord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killed, indeed? I guess you would think so,”
exclaimed Buzz. “They have shot one fine, plump
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is probably Snobb. He is the plump one,”
said Fuzz, contracting his lips, and looking sternly
round at the members of the committee. “Did he
fall dead on the spot?” he rejoined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead as Julius Cæsar—I may say very dead,”
replied Buzz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Serious business this, gentlemen,” said Fuzz,
dilating with importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mr. Rattle, the tinman, was seen to mount
his horse and gallop off in the direction of Tattletown.
He was determined to be the first to communicate
the news of the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be no need of your services, Mr.
Blister,” said Fuzz, bestowing a patronizing glance
upon the apothecary. “Have the seconds escaped,
Mr. Buzz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the second one escaped, but with a bullet in
his neck. They tracked him a mile or two by his
blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dreadful!” muttered Mr. Blister. “So Fobb is
wounded! I will just ride back and inform Miss
Scragg of the fact. She will go into hysterics, and
I shall get a job.” And so saying, the apothecary
mounted his horse, and followed in Rattle’s track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done with the killed, Mr. Buzz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we have skinned him, and hung him up to
dry, to be sure. One of the gents <span class='it'>would</span> have a slice
of him for dinner, but he found it rather tough eating
I suspect; not quite equal to the ducks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” exclaimed Fuzz, turning pale and starting
back with horror. “Are they cannibals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to be sure,” responded Buzz, who did not
fully comprehend the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, we must pursue the guilty fugitives,”
said the squire. “What direction did they
take, landlord? No equivocation, sir. The law will
bear us out in adopting the most rigorous measures.
Where are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, they are cosily seated at dinner in my
little back parlor. I wouldn’t interrupt them now.
It may make them mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Landlord! Lead us to them at once—at once, I
say,” exclaimed Fuzz, turning very red about the
gills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, squire, don’t talk so loud. I will show you
the way, but mind that I say I shouldn’t wonder if
they resented it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Buzz led the way through a long entry to a door,
which he pointed out to the squire as communicating
with the apartment where the “young gentlemen”
were assembled. It needed not his words to convince
Fuzz and his two remaining companions of this
fact. A noise of uproarious mirth, mingled with the
jingling of glasses, the clash of plates and the stamping
of feet, plainly foretold the state of things within.
Fuzz buttoned his coat, and tried to look undismayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “stand by me. Don’t
flinch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a bold step forward, but as his palm approached
the door-handle, an explosion of laughter,
loud and long, made him recoil like a man who has
barely saved himself from falling over a precipice.
He looked at his associates, puffed out his cheeks,
and seemed to be gathering energy for a renewed
essay. Again he stopped suddenly, and assuming a
look of unwonted sagacity, remarked that it was best
to proceed gently and craftily about the business.
Then motioning the bystanders to keep silence, he
cautiously turned the handle of the door, and, opening
it an inch or two, stealthily looked in upon the
convivial party. It consisted of four nice young
men. They were seated at a round table, which
was plentifully covered with bottles, decanters,
glasses, and the remains of a dessert. Two of the
party were strangers to Fuzz, but the other two were,
marvellous to behold, no other than Fobb and Snobb,
not seamed with ghastly wounds, but quaffing
champagne and clapping each other on the back
with the affectionate familiarity of old friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this spectacle, Fuzz was no less amazed than
he would have been, had he seen one of the editors
trussed, spitted and “done to a turn,” served up in
a big dish on the table, while the other was flourishing
his knife with the savory anticipation of making a
meal of him. Cautiously shutting the door, Fuzz
communicated the astounding fact to his brethren of
the committee, and then reopening the door so that
they might hear without seeing or being seen, they
listened “with all their ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, gentlemen,” said the voice of Fobb in tones
of mock solemnity, “you behold in that abandoned
individual, my unworthy brother Zeke Peabody,
otherwise known as Simon Snobb—you behold in
him, I repeat, the ruthless, unhung murderer of the
unfortunate Amanda W——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here a roar of obstreperous laughter, in which
Snobb’s lungs seemed to crow like chanticleer, interrupted
the speaker for a moment. He continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you ask me for proofs, consider for a moment
the fact of the red silk handkerchief—the white crape
scarf—the old pruning-knife that was found under the
cherry-tree. If these circumstances be not enough to
convict that cowering culprit—then pass along the
champagne, and fill to my toast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fill to Fobb’s toast!” exclaimed three voices
amid shouts of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My toast,” said Fobb, “is one that cannot fail to
be appreciated by this intelligent company. You, my
dear Timms, will drink to it with a tear in your eye,
for are you not the immortal inventor of the world-renowned
Tricogrophpophphlogidion, that invaluable
and never-to-be-sufficiently-commended preparation
for the hair, by merely spreading which over a
wig-block, you find there the next morning, a beautiful,
curly wig, redundant and glossy? And you, O
modest and retiring Jones, are not you the man that,
by your grandfather’s celebrated pills, have rejuvenated
suffering humanity? Have you not ‘floored
consumption,’ and broken the back of dispepsia?
Isn’t it a man’s own fault now if he is sick? Do not
children cry for your incomparable lozenges? Are
they not a blessing to mothers, and a curse to the
doctors? Cannot a hand-cart-man, with your powerful
‘poor man’s plaster’ on his back, draw fifty
times the weight that he could without it? Estimable,
philanthropic Jones! Posterity will do you
justice. And you, brother Zeke, in Tattletown
known as Snobb, where shall we find an editor in
the country who can fight windmills and make people
think they are devouring despots with a better
grace than yourself? My own accomplishments modesty
forbids me to speak at length; but I flatter myself,
that the story of Amanda W⁠—— and the
pruning-knife—and my eloquent denunciations of the
monster, Snobb—are not unworthy specimens of
those talents which entitle me to rank myself in your
fraternity, and to participate in the emotions, which
the sentiment I am now about to offer is calculated
to excite. I will give you, gentlemen: <span class='it'>Vive la humbug!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had the peals of laughter consequent upon
this prolonged sally subsided, when Fuzz, who was
holding on to the door by the handle, being pressed
upon from behind by his own companions, and two
or three bar-room loungers, whom the sound of
speech-making had attracted to the spot, suddenly
let the handle slip from his grasp, whereupon the
whole body of eaves-droppers, preceded by the
squire, were precipitated into the room, where the
two editors and their friends were at their revels.
Imagining it to be a hostile invasion, the four friends,
whose tempers had been pretty well primed with
champagne, immediately “squared off,” and showed
their “science.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuzz was greeted by Timms with what the latter
was pleased to call “a settler in his bread-basket,”
which had the effect of lifting him from his feet, and
spinning him into a corner of the room with a most
unmagisterial celerity. Mr. Ponder, the “celebrated
lecturer on matters and things in general,” was
attended to in the most prompt manner by Jones,
who, as he technically expressed himself, “punished
him by a dig in his dice-box,” meaning that his blow
took effect somewhere in the region of his teeth.
As for Rumble, the auctioneer, he was knocked
down by a bottle in the hand of Snobb, like an
old remnant of goods disposed of under his own
hammer. The rest of the invaders met with due
attention from Fobb, who broke two chairs over as
many heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle was speedily fought and won. The committee
sent by the select men of Tattletown returned
home that night in melancholy disarray, and imprecating
vengeance upon their assailants. There was
an immediate demand in the village for brown paper
and vinegar, court plaster and lint. It was long before
Mr. Ponder could deliver another lecture at the
new Lyceum, owing to the disfigurement of his
countenance. As for Snobb and Fobb, who were in
fact the originators of the whole mischief, they
issued no more numbers of their sprightly papers.
The “Independent,” and the “Free and Independent”
were abruptly stopped. The two brother editors
were never more seen in Tattletown. The last I
heard of them, one was lecturing on Animal Magnetism,
while the other accompanied him as a subject
for his experiments. Their wonderful feats in
clairvoyance have been so trumpeted by the country
press, that it is unnecessary for me to allude to them
more minutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are some persons in the world who seem
born to evil fortune; they grow up under the shadow
of care, and misfortune dogs their footsteps like a
sleuth-hound eager for his prey. Reversing the old
fable of King Midas, every thing they touch becomes
valueless. Their best efforts are rewarded with disappointment,—their
life is a perpetual struggle,—troubles
come not in a host which might be confronted
at once, but in slow and sure succession, one
evil being overcome only to make room for another,
until at length the energies of the worn spirit are all
exhausted, and patient endurance is the only trace
which still remains of the high capabilities with
which it was originally gifted. But there are others
who are decidedly born to good luck. (Poor Power!
how do we check the career of laughter with a sigh,
when some passing word recalls the inimitable skill
with which he ruled the chords of mirth!) There
are people to whom success is a sort of natural
inheritance,—who never put forth a finger to beckon
fortune onwards, and yet find her following in their
track, dropping her golden favours in their way, and
smoothing with obsequious care the asperities in their
path of life. Such an one was the hero of the following
sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Simon D. Waldie, or rather S. De Courcy
Waldie, (for thus he always wrote it; having rather
a leaning towards aristocracy even in the trifling
matter of names,) was the son of a highly respectable
merchant, who, conscious of the defects in his own
early education, determined to bestow on his child
all the advantages of scholarship. As young De
Courcy exhibited evidences of talent, and indeed was
looked upon as a remarkably precocious boy ere he
attained his fifth year, he was early banished from his
paternal roof to the residence of a private tutor in
the country. This plan was adopted in order to
rescue him from the temptations to idleness which
exist in large schools, and, so far, it was very judicious.
But to a constitution naturally delicate and a
temper exceedingly reserved, a public school offered
some advantages which were not to be found in the
home of a secluded student, and the want of which
had no small influence on the future life of young
De Courcy. Shut out from other companionship
than that of his pedantic tutor, he devoted himself
to study with most indefatigable zeal, and his close
application was rewarded by the attainment of the
highest honours, when called to pass through the
ordeal of a collegiate examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course all those who were interested in his
future welfare anticipated great results from this
early development of mind. But in the education of
the young student one most material point had been
forgotten. He had been taught to labor but no object
had been offered to his future attainment:—he had
learned to delve the classic mine but he knew not
how to coin the fine gold he there discovered:—he
had been trained to run a race without having
any fixed goal to direct his steps. His life was
a perfectly aimless one,—he had no definite end in
view. His father’s competent fortune placed him
above the necessity of seeking a livelihood, and
nothing short of absolute want seemed likely to drive
the solitary student into the haunts of men. When
desired to choose a profession he was utterly confounded.
The various claims of Law, Gospel and
Physic were placed before him in every possible
light; but they were exhibited after his habits of
desultory thought and profitless study had become
too deeply rooted. At first he was inclined to adopt
the law; but a few days attendance on court, (where
he heard the finest powers of reasoning and the
noblest gifts of eloquence exerted in behalf of one
of the vilest criminals that ever stood before the bar
of Justice,) sickened him of this profession. “I
cannot spend some of the best years of my life,”
said he, “in learning to make the worse appear the
better reason.” The delight with which he sometimes
listened to the gifted preacher, who spoke as if
his lips had been ‘touched with a live coal from the
altar,’ tempted him to the study of divinity. But his
delicate sense of duty checked the impulse ere it
became a wish, for he dared not assume the ‘form’
without the ‘spirit of godliness’ or enter into the
‘holy of holies’ with the soil of earth upon his garments’
hem. The study of medicine attracted him
by the facilities which it afforded for relieving the
sufferings of mortality; but the illness of a young
friend showed him the darker side of the picture also.
He beheld the weeping relatives looking up to the
medical attendant as if he were an angel endowed
with the power of life and death. He learned how
fearful is the responsibility of him who ministers at
the bed of sickness, and how deeply it is felt by the
honest and conscientious physician. He was disgusted
with the heartlessness of those (and there are
such) who calculate a patient’s means of payment
ere they enter his sick room; and he was intimidated
by the remembrance of the wear and tear of feeling
which is necessarily suffered by the man of science
who puts heart and soul into his duties at the couch
of suffering. Commerce, De Courcy abhorred, for
the details of its busy scenes were little suited to
his reserved habits and refined tastes. Viewed in its
fairest light he recognised it as a noble calling, but
those who pursued it were but too apt to wander
with idolatry and bow down before the golden
calf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the youth hesitated, and deferred his decision,
passing his days amid his books in the seclusion of
his study until his habits of reverie were rather
rudely broken by the sudden death of his father.
This startled him from his torpor and had he been
then called to enter upon the active duties of life,
might have aroused him more effectually. But the
elder Mr. Waldie had been one of those careful
bodies who trust nothing to chance. Every thing
was in such perfect order, his business was so admirably
arranged, and his will was so precise in its
directions that De Courcy had nothing to do and
little to reflect upon. The head clerk assumed the
business and purchased the stock in trade,—the income
of the property was bequeathed to mother and
son during life with a reversion of the whole estate
to the survivor, and after the legal forms had been
properly attended to, every thing went on in its
usual manner. The only perceptible difference was
that when rents, or interests on bonds and mortgages
became due the bold and flourishing signature of S.
De Courcy Waldie was appended to the receipts
instead of the cramped and queer hieroglyphics
which were formerly presumed to designate the
name of his parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in the mode of life peculiarly
calculated to cherish the secluded habits of De
Courcy Waldie. Their abode was situated in one of
those narrow gloomy streets, where the sun is only
visible at noonday,—a street which formed, in old
times, a portion of the ‘court-end’ of the city, but
which is now occupied principally by elderly proprietors
or decayed gentlewomen, who, compelled to
live on a small income, yet unwilling to appear shorn
of their former honors, haunt the scenes of their
youthful gaiety, and affect to despise the upstart
‘nobodies’ of B—— Street and —— Place. The tall,
dusky houses stand wedged in close array, looking
upon their opposite neighbors like a row of their old
time-worn spinsters in an old fashioned contra-dance;
in one of these sleepy-looking mansions, resided
the Waldie family. Every thing in the house bore
evidences of Dutch neatness in housekeeping. The
faded but unworn carpets were the same which had
been the wonder of the neighborhood when the
parents of our hero were first married; the carved
chairs belonged to that perpendicular race now rarely
to be found except in rubbish rooms; the narrow
necked china jars on the high chimney-piece were
relics of a by-gone age; and the tall clock, standing
in the very spot where it had been placed thirty
years before, rolled its Ethiop eyes, and ticked its
monotonous warnings in a most drowsy and slumber-inducing
voice. Dark heavy curtains in winter, and
yellow Venitian half-blinds in summer, added to the
gloomy appearance of apartments in which the sun
never shone. The sound of the clock, the low purr
of the cat as she stretched her overgrown body on
the soft hearth-rug, and the dull clicking of Mrs.
Waldie’s knitting-needles, which she plied with unceasing
assiduity, alone broke the deep silence of
the apartment, and the most sincere votary of indolence
could scarcely have imagined a more comfortable
sort of domestic “sleepy-hollow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here would Mr. De Courcy Waldie sit hour after
hour, pondering over some learned treatise, digging
out Greek roots, exhausting his ingenuity in patching
up some mutilated fragment of antiquity, and occasionally,
by way of light reading, arousing himself
with the Latin Poets, but never condescending to
look into any thing which could not boast the musty
flavor of past ages, except the daily newspapers. It
is not strange that a man of such habits should soon
learn to mistake <span class='it'>reverie</span> for <span class='it'>reflection</span>, and <span class='it'>feasible
projects</span> for <span class='it'>good resolutions</span>. There was always
something which he meant to do at some future time.
He would tilt himself back in his chair, plant his feet
against the chimney-piece, and, with a cigar in his
mouth, indulge those vague and pleasant but idle
dreams, which such men are apt to dignify with the
name of thoughts. The household went on with a
kind of mechanical regularity. The important affairs
of indoor life were managed by two old servants,
who, before the abolition of slavery in New York,
had been the property of Mr. Waldie, and had been
carefully trained in all the duties of their station, (a
class, by the way, who make the very best domestics,
but who are now almost extinct; thanks to the
spirit of philanthropy, which has thrown them upon
their own resources and left them to die by want,
vice and intemperance.) Mrs. Waldie walked into
the kitchen every morning, and gave, or fancied she
gave directions for the day; but Dinah needed no
such watchfulness,—she knew her business and went
about it as regularly as if she were wound up like
the clock every Saturday night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early part of his life it had been suggested
that De Courcy ought to look out for a wife. But the
idea of returning into a throng of giddy giggling girls,
was quite too trying to the poor youth’s feelings. He
was sometimes conscious of an emotion of pleasure
when, as he sat at the head of his pew in church, his
eye fell upon the rosy cheek and bright eye of some
fair damsel. Yet he only admired at a respectful distance,
for a single word from a lady, or even the necessity
of touching his hat to her in the street, would
crimson his face with the painful blush of most officious
modesty. If perchance he did venture to play
the agreeable to some female less volatile than her
companions, his constrained manner and pedantic
compliments evinced a much more intimate acquaintance
with the Daphnes and Chloes of antiquity, than
with the luring, breathing, captivating beauties of the
nineteenth century. By degrees all hope of taming
the shy young student was relinquished. His female
contemporaries married less intractable individuals,
and long before he had made up his mind as to the
propriety of assuming the responsibilities of wedlock,
a second race of giggling girls was springing up
around him. However he seemed quite contented
with his celibacy. Perhaps some of my readers may
consider this as a very integral portion of the good
fortune which had fallen to his lot, and this I will not
venture to dispute, for to a man of his dreamy temper
and indolent habits, a wife would have been a
positive annoyance—unless indeed, he could have
found a sister to the inimitable “<span class='it'>fat boy</span>” of Pickwick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matters went on very smoothly with De Courcy
Waldie until he had attained that awkward corner
in man’s life, which must be turned, and the pathway
from which leads rather down hill. Mr. De Courcy
Waldie reached his forty-fifth birth-day, ere he had
decided upon a profession or concluded to take a wife,
but his time had glided away so calmly, that he
scarcely noted its loss, till a second domestic bereavement
aroused him. Quiet old ladies, who do
not trouble themselves about their neighbors and
never talk scandal, generally spin out life to its most
attenuated thread, and thus Mrs. Waldie dozed away
until she had completed her eighty-fourth year, when
she fell into a sound sleep from which she never
woke. It was not until the bustle attendant upon the
funeral, had subsided, that the son had time to think
of his loss, and then, when left to the utter solitude
of his home—for the first time in his life he was sensible
of actual profound grief. He did not know how
essential his mother’s presence had become to him.
He was so accustomed to see her in the warmest
corner in winter, and by the recess of the window in
summer, that the apartment seemed to have lost, not
only one of its inmates, but part of its furniture. Her
tiny work-table and easy chair still held their wonted
place, but she who was almost a part of them, was
gone forever, and a feeling of loneliness took possession
of his heart. He knew not, until the form of
that revered parent was hidden from his sight, how
often his eye had wandered from the page of his favourite
book, to rest on her placid face. He remembered
how carefully she had studied his tastes, how
scrupulously she had obeyed his wishes, how well
she had adapted herself to his peculiar habits; and
when he reflected upon the different degree of his
grief at the loss of his father, he began to think
that there was something in the nature of woman
particularly calculated to make man happy. This
thought was followed by regret at not having secured
a continuance of womanly tenderness for his future
life. In the natural order of events, he must long
outlive his mother, and who would have supplied her
place, like a devoted wife. Mr. De Courcy Waldie
began to wish he was married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The longer he dreamed over this new idea, however,
the more his difficulties seemed to increase.
He thought of the pretty delicate girls whom he had
admired in his college days, but he recollected them
now as fat comfortable matrons, or thin, withered
spinsters; and he looked in his mirror as if to discover
whether age had made the same havoc with
his appearance. But the daily use of the said useful
appendage of the toilet had rendered him so gradually
habituated to time’s changes, that he could discern
little difference in himself. He had never possessed
much of the bloom of youth, and his face had early
worn the pale student-like ‘cast of thought,’ which
years had only traced in deeper characters. His
dapper little figure, still trim and upright, was not
spoiled by the obesity so much dreaded by elderly
gentlemen; his teeth were still perfect—his incipient
baldness—but this was an exceedingly delicate
point—we will draw the veil of silence over his
reflections on this painful subject. Suffice it to say
that Mr. De Courcy Waldie came to the conclusion
that he was yet young enough to think of matrimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was necessary for him to proceed with great
caution however, for he knew that he was reputed
rich, and he heard that society contained such anomalies
as mercenary young ladies. While thinking
over his new project, he was one day called upon for
a subscription to some benevolent association, by
one of those charitable persons who relieve the real
or fancied distresses of their fellow mortals, by a free
expenditure of <span class='it'>their own time</span> and their <span class='it'>neighbor’s
money</span>. With his usual generosity, Mr. Waldie
handed her a liberal contribution, not sorry perhaps,
to buy off her garrulity at such a price. But the lady
dropped some words ere she departed, which set
him off upon a new track. She had suggested the
propriety of his adopting some orphan boy and educating
him as his own. This was quite a new idea
to him, but he viewed it in rather a different light
from that which his visitor had intended. “Adopt a
son,” said he to himself, in a tone that seemed
strangely like disgust, “no indeed. I should go crazy
with a rollicking boy ransacking the house, and
turning every thing upside down. Besides, boys
have always got dirty faces, and they are forever
cutting their fingers with their penknives, breaking
their heads against horse posts or cracking their skulls
on skating ponds; then they always tear their trousers,
lose their gloves, and stump their toes through
their shoes. Faugh! I can’t endure great rude bearish
boys. If she had said a daughter now, I might
have thought better of it; there is certainly something
very pleasant in a nice little quiet girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more he reflected upon this fancy, the better
he liked it, but the idea of adopting a daughter soon
gave place to a more eccentric scheme. He determined
to make an experiment. He would ‘train up’
a child in the way she should go; he would <span class='it'>educate
a wife</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was the loss of his mother which had
awakened him from his apathy, or whether the long
latent affections of his nature were now only developing
themselves, cannot be determined, but, certain
it is, that before he had dreamed over his project
three months, Mr. De Courcy Waldie actually applied
to the managers of the Orphan Asylum for permission
to adopt <span class='it'>three</span> of the female inmates. He
engaged to educate them according to their different
capacities, to furnish them with the means of obtaining
a future livelihood, and to settle the sum of two
thousand dollars on each, when she should either
marry or attain her majority. His character for probity
and honor, was as well known as his eccentricity,
and as no doubt existed of the fulfilment of his
promises, his proposition was accepted. He was
allowed to select his three protégées, and however
ignorant he might be of female character, he showed
himself no mean judge of female beauty, for his
choice fell on three of the loveliest children in the
institution. He wished them to be about twelve
years of age, and there was but the difference of a
few months between them. They were poor, friendless
orphans, destined to a life of hardship if not of
want, and he knew that if his experiment terminated
unsuccessfully, the girls would be better provided for
by his means, than if they were apprenticed to some
hard task-master. He determined to bestow on all
the same care, to educate them after his own peculiar
notions, and when they should have attained a
proper age, to decide upon their individual claims to
his affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old servants shook their heads in ominous
silence, when they learned the sudden increase of
family. Old Dinah went so far as to hint that his
mother’s death had touched Mr. Waldie’s brain, and
indeed wiser folks than she came to something like
the same conclusion. But your quiet people, who
are so amazingly slow in waking up to any purpose,
pursue it with wonderful perseverance, when once
fairly placed on the track. Mr. Waldie engaged an
elderly governess to take charge of his young wards,
and an apartment in the upper part of the house was
appropriated to her use as a schoolroom. It was
agreed that the privacy of Mr. Waldie’s sitting room
should never be violated by the intrusion of the females,
except when he invited them to enter its
hallowed precincts. His old-fashioned politeness
regulated the etiquette of the table at their daily
meals, and very soon the household assumed its
usual regularity, notwithstanding the presence of
three little girls. Mr. Waldie did not consider them
old enough to deserve his particular attention for the
present, and he therefore left them to the care of
their very competent governess: only stipulating that
they were never to be allowed to read poetry or
fiction—never to wear any other dress than a calico
frock, white apron and cottage bonnet,—and by no
means, to form an acquaintance with other children.
Having made these rules he returned to his former
abstract studies, until such a time as he should deem
it proper to undertake the instruction of his young
protégées.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had chosen the little girls rather on account of
their personal beauty than with any regard to their
mental gifts, for of these he determined to judge for
himself, and it was not surprising, therefore, that he
should discover great diversity in their characters.
Fanny Morris, the elder of the three, possessed that
regular and classical beauty which ever charms the
eye in the remnants of Grecian art. Her features
were perfect, her complexion exquisite, her form
symmetry itself, but unfortunately, she seemed born
to verify the oft-repeated criticism on that paragon
of ideal beauty, the Venus de Medici, of whom it
has been said that “if a woman exactly resembling
her could be found in this breathing world, she would
in all probability, (judging by the rules of physiognomy
and phrenology) be <span class='it'>an idiot</span>.” Fanny’s small and
beautifully shaped head was utterly destitute of
brains—her soft dark eyes were never lighted up
with any loftier expression than that of pleasure at
sight of a box of sugar plums—and her lovely mouth
gave utterance to none but the silliest of speeches.
She could learn nothing, and after a year spent in
fruitless attempts to impart more than the mere rudiments
of knowledge, she was given up as incorrigible.
But mindful of his promise Mr. Waldie gave her the
choice of an avocation, and finding her only capable
of the most mechanical employment, he apprenticed
her to a fringe and fancy-button maker; at the same
time he purchased, in her name, bank stock to the
amount of two thousand dollars, as her future dowry.
Fanny seemed to have as little heart as mind, and
parted from her benefactor with no regret. As we
shall not have occasion to allude to her again, it may
be as well to satisfy the reader’s curiosity by stating
that her beauty afterwards attracted the attention of
a young artist, who wanted just such a model. Finding
that her quiet stupidity rendered her a most untiring
<span class='it'>sitter</span>, while her two thousand dollars added
weight to her other attractions, the painter married
her, and much of his present celebrity is owing to
the matchless loveliness of his silly wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the two children who now remained under Mr.
Waldie’s roof, Emily Rivers was by far the most
strikingly beautiful. Her blonde hair fell in rich
curls upon her fat, white shoulders, while her delicate
features, and large clear blue eyes gave an infantile
grace to her lovely countenance. There was
a frank joyousness in her expression, which was
very attractive, and, at that time, few would have
hesitated in giving her the preference over her young
companion. Celina Morley was one of those children
whose personal characteristics develop very
slowly. She was short in stature, and slightly inclined
to stoop, while her gray eyes, whose hue
was deepened almost into blackness by the shadow
of the fringed lid, and a small mouth filled up with
pearly teeth, formed her only claims to admiration.
Her face appeared out of proportion—her forehead
was so immensely high, her brows so thick and dark
her cheeks so colorless, that her countenance seemed
like some modern engravings, all <span class='it'>black and white</span>,
without tints of light and shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was this difference in their personal appearance
the only one which existed between the two
girls. The shy, quiet demeanor of Celina, contrasted
strongly with the frank, bold manner of her companion.
Emily would run to meet Mr. Waldie with a
gay laugh, and throwing herself on a footstool beside
him, would beguile him with her merry prattle,
without seeming to care whether he were annoyed
by her intrusion. But Celina would stand timidly
awaiting an encouraging word from her benefactor,
and thus it often happened, in the little household as
in the great world, that modest merit was overlooked
in favor of obtrusive importunity, and Celina was
forgotten for the more clamorous Emily. Yet it was
Celina who brought the dressing-gown the very moment
it was wanted, and drew the easy-chair into
the accustomed corner—it was Celina who laid the
slippers just where his feet would be sure to find
them without giving the head trouble to think about
them; it was Celina who, when he was confined to
his bed by sickness, watched in his room through the
long day, and listened at his door in the silent hours
of the night. But the caresses of Emily had opened
a fountain of tenderness in Mr. Waldie’s bosom, and
after they had been inmates of his family for rather
more than two years, he felt that the time had come
when his course of instruction must commence.
What that course was it is needless to specify; let it
suffice to know that he destined them to pursue a
series of studies which would have appalled the
most zealous aspirant for college honors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The true character of the two girls began now to
be exhibited. They were approaching their fifteenth
year, and the fresh, glowing beauty of Emily Rivers
had already excited the notice of strangers. She had
observed the stolen glance of admiration, she had
even heard the sudden exclamation of delight, as
some ardent youth peeped under the close cottage
bonnet, while she walked demurely beside her benefactor
or her governess, in their daily promenades,
and the latent vanity of her nature had been fully
aroused. The calico dress and white apron annoyed
her sadly. She was full of projects for making Mr.
Waldie sensible of the folly of his restrictions, and
while he was busied in teaching them to solve algebraic
problems, she was as busy in devising schemes
for eluding his vigilance. She had no taste for study,
but she had tact and quickness of comprehension and
thus it often happened that her adroitness stood her
in the stead of application and industry. While Celina
devoted herself to the performance of her required
tasks, Emily exerted her ingenuity in evading them,
or in skilfully applying to her own use, the industry
and talent of her young companion. But Emily had
a most decided love for dress. She was wonderfully
tasteful in trimming bonnets and furbelowing dresses
and debarred from any such pleasures for her own
account, she amused her leisure hours by furbishing
up old Dinah (who was particularly fond of a fine
spreading knot of ribbons) and regarnishing the head
gear of all the dingy dame’s dressy acquaintances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length her vanity would no longer be controlled.
The girls received a regular allowance of pocket-money,
which it was expected they would spend in
charity, and this sum Emily hoarded up until she
was enabled to purchase some of the long-coveted
finery. Determined to try the strength of Mr. Waldie’s
rules, she came down to the parlor one Sunday
morning, prepared to accompany him to church, clad
in her new attire. For a few minutes he looked at
her in stern silence, while, with a beating heart but
resolute spirit, she awaited his reproaches. The
little cottage bonnet had given place to a tawdry
pink silk hat, flaunting with streamers of lace and
ribbons, and instead of her simple white cape her
shoulders were now covered with a bright yellow
gauze scarf. She had certainly not improved her
appearance by her new display, but she wished to
try the effect of a little rebellion, and she was fully
satisfied. Mr. Waldie quietly desired her to change
her dress,—she remonstrated,—he insisted,—she
grew angry and exhibited a degree of fiery passion,
which, though by no means strange to the other
members of the family, had hitherto been carefully
concealed from him; until at length, irritated by her
vehement opposition, he led her to her apartment
and locked her in. There were three faults which
Mr. Waldie regarded with peculiar abhorrence in
the female character, and these were a passionate
temper, a love of dress, and a determined will. He
was perfectly horror-stricken, therefore, at the sudden
discovery of all these most dreaded attributes
in the beautiful Emily. Nor was his disgust much
diminished, when, on his return from church, he
proceeded to her apartment to receive, as he hoped,
an humble confession of her fault. He found her
leaning from the window engaged in an interesting
conversation with a beardless young gentleman who
resided in the adjoining house, and who was now
standing on the top of a ladder placed against the
garden wall, in order to be within whispering or
rather murmuring distance of the young lady, with
whom he had for some months carried on a flirtation
by means of billets tied to pebbles and flung into her
window. This of course decided the matter. Emily
was desired by her benefactor to make choice of
some trade, and, as she fancied it must be perfectly
delightful to live among finery, she decided upon
adopting the <span class='it'>profession</span> of a milliner. Accordingly,
Latin and Geometry were exchanged for frippery and
folly. Emily soon became a most skilful <span class='it'>artiste</span>, and,
by exhibiting their effect on her beautiful face, which
nothing could spoil, was the means of selling so
many ugly bonnets and turbans, that she was quite a
prize to her employer. At the age of eighteen she
married a fashionable draper and tailor, when she
received her promised dowry from the hand of Mr.
Waldie. As the business of both husband and
wife was one which ministered to the master spirit
of vanity, they made a large fortune in a few years,
and I have heard—but I will not vouch for the truth
of the story—that after their retirement, Colonel
Fitwell and his beautiful wife made quite a figure in
the saloons of Paris, where she could boast of the
honor of having been noticed by royalty; his majesty
having been heard to ask the name of that
very <span class='it'>large woman</span> with blonde hair! What an honor
for a simple republican!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Celina Morley was now left alone, and the punishment
inflicted on her companion, for such to her
sensitive nature it seemed, rather tended to increase
her timid reserve. But she possessed high intellectual
gifts and a great love for study, so that her progress
in learning equalled her eccentric benefactor’s
highest anticipations. I am afraid she would have
been deemed a blue-stocking in the circles of fashion,
for she was a fine Latin scholar, read Greek with
great ease, had not even been delayed on the Pons
Asinorum in her mathematical career, and in short,
when she had attained her eighteenth year, knew
considerably more than most collegians when they
take their degree. Do not think this is an over-estimate
of the attainments of our heroine, gentle reader.
Let an intelligent woman be endowed with industry,
perseverance and a love for study, then give her a
powerful motive, such as love or gratitude, to stimulate
her, and all the boasted intellect of man will
hardly outstrip her in the race of learning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The person of Celina had developed as fully as
her mind. Her swarthy complexion had cleared into
a fine brunette, her dark hair parted smoothly on her
high forehead, added feminine grace to a rather
masculine feature, while the intellectual expression
which beamed in her fine eyes, lighted up her whole
face with positive beauty. Her form had become
tall and majestic, scarcely rounded enough for perfect
symmetry, but just such a figure as expands
with queenly grace in later life. In short, Celina
had become a stately, beautiful, and gifted woman.
But while all these things had been going on, Mr.
Waldie had become some six or seven years older,
and already passed his <span class='it'>fiftieth</span> year; yet some how
or other, he did not seem to be very impatient to
change his condition. It is true, Celina had attained
the age which he had originally destined to be the
period of marriage, but he felt so very comfortable
and was so much the creature of habit, that he
seemed rather to dread any innovation. He had
taken the precaution to keep his wards in ignorance
of his final intentions, and therefore, Celina loved
him with truly filial affection, without dreaming that
she might be called upon to cherish any warmer
emotion. As she grew up to the stature of womanhood,
Mr. Waldie had been induced, by the remonstrance
of the governess, to withdraw some of his
restrictions in female attire; and though he still
insisted on a rigid proscription of bows, feathers,
flowers and lace, he allowed Celina to assume a
garb somewhat in accordance with the prevailing
fashion. But he had forbidden her to acquire any
feminine accomplishment except sewing and knitting.
The first act he found very necessary to his own
comfort, as strings would break, and buttons would
come off, which evils no one could repair with such
neat-handed rapidity as Celina; while the second
mystery he looked upon as essential to every well-trained
woman, because it had been the sole occupation
of his mother for the last twenty years of her
life. But sad to tell! the young victim of theory could
neither dance, nor play on the piano, nor sketch
in crayons, nor paint velvet, nor make filigree
boxes, nor work worsted:—in short, she was utterly
unskilled in the thousand lady-like arts of <span class='it'>idle
industry</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet nature had made her beautiful and good, education
had made her a fine scholar, and her innate
tact (without which talent and learning are often but
useless gifts) had taught her womanly duties and
womanly tastes. Indeed she had rather too much
feminine delicacy to suit the peculiar notions of Mr.
Waldie. He had an idea that the want of physical
courage, which characterizes the sex, was simply an
error in female education, and, not content with the
passive endurance and moral strength which make
woman a heroine in the chamber of pestilence, he
determined that Celina should possess some share of
masculine boldness. Accordingly, he practised various
fantastic experiments to habituate her to pain and
terror. He dropped hot sealing-wax on her bare
arms, fired pistols within six inches of her head, and
practised various feats of a similar nature, until,
after having thrice set fire to her dress by accident,
and once shocked her into a fit of sickness, he gave
up his attempt in despair of ever bringing her to the
required point of courage. Mr. Waldie was a little
disappointed. Celina did not quite realize his ideal
of the partner of his life. She bore little resemblance
to the dull, drowsy, quiet creature, who,
soon after his mother’s death, seemed to fulfil his
notions of wifely excellence, and neither was she
that most unfeminine of all females—a plodding and
slovenly book-worm. She was simply a gentle,
lovely, intellectual woman, whom profound learning
had failed to make either a pedant or a metaphysician.
Do not listen to your prejudices, friend
reader, and fancy that I am portraying an immaterial
character: such women are to be found—sometimes
in the saloons of gaiety but more frequently in the
shades of private life, and the fire on the domestic
hearth may still burn brightly and cheerfully even
when lighted by the torch of wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year or two more passed on. Mr. Waldie seemed
to linger long on the threshold of celibacy ere he
could summon courage to cross it, and in the meantime
he was spared all future anxiety about the matter.
Among the few, who still kept up their acquaintance
with the eccentric Mr. Waldie, was the head-clerk
of his deceased father, who, grateful for the
liberal treatment which he had received at the settlement
of the estate, was always ready to do a
kindness for the heir. Unpunctual tenants and troublesome
debtors were peculiar objects of his watchfulness,
and Mr. Waldie was saved from many a loss
and many a vexation by his honest friend. The son
of this gentleman, after receiving a liberal education,
had devoted himself to the church, and, as Mr.
Waldie’s extensive library furnished a great variety
of polemical works, he had gladly accepted the bachelor’s
kind invitation to visit it at all times, without
restraint. At first young Willington Merwyn
came rarely, and taking some dusty volume of controversial
divinity would retire to his own quiet
study. By degrees he learned to linger longer, and
ponderous tomes which he formerly sought were
often forgotten when he took his departure. He
came frequently and staid late, while Mr. Waldie,
absorbed in his own speculative philosophy, always
greeted the presence of the clergyman as a tribute
to the value of his intellectual stores, or a compliment
to his own scholarship. He fancied, good man,
that the long metaphysical discussions and ingenious
theories, in which he took so much delight, were the
young man’s chief attraction, and never dreamed
that even the presence of philosophy herself,</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>would have awakened far less emotion in the bosom
of Willington Merwyn than did the beauty and gentleness
of Celina. But the lady herself had some
little inkling of the truth, for women seem to have
a sort of intuitive knowledge of the heart’s love.
There were looks and tones and casual words which
needed no interpreter, or if they did, she soon found
one in her own feelings. She discovered that the
visits of the clergyman were only recurring pleasures
to her, and she reflected upon the matter till she
came to the very natural conclusion, that, considering
the warm regard manifested by her benefactor to
his young friend, it probably was his wish that they
should obey the command of the apostle to “love
one another.” Not long after she had arrived at this
conclusion, one of those lucky chances, which
always favor lovers, revealed to her the fact that
Mr. Merwyn had precisely the same opinion. In
short, if the commandment already quoted had contained
the sum of Christian duty, they would certainly
have been regarded as eminently excellent
young persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course the elder Mr. Merwyn was soon made
acquainted with his son’s passion for Celina, and,
following the honest old-fashioned mode of transacting
such affairs, he thought it best to be sure of his
friend’s approbation. Now it so happened that Mr.
Waldie was at length coming to a decision on the
momentous subject which had so long occupied his
thoughts. He had made up his mind that, however
reluctant he might feel to assume the responsible
duties of matrimony, a further delay would be an act
of cruel injustice to Celina. He thought over all her
good qualities, and, though he did not quite like her
cowardice, he determined that, rather than doom her
to a life of celibacy, he would celebrate his <span class='it'>fifty-fifth</span>
birth-day by a wedding. It cost him some effort to
make this decision; for, in addition to his natural
indolence which led him to dread any change in his
mode of life, Mr. Waldie had one secret which he
could not bear to betray. It was one of his weak
points—nobody knew it, and he dreaded lest the
familiar intercourse of married life should reveal it.
Nothing but a sense of duty towards his ward could
have induced him to overcome this last objection
which seemed to have gained new force with the
progress of time. It was just at this moment, when
his heroic self-devotion had carried him to the verge
of an explanation with Celina, that Mr. Merwyn,
with sundry nods, and winks, and dry jokes, disclosed
to him the wishes of the young people. Mr.
Waldie was thunder-struck. It seemed to him too
preposterous for belief, but it was sufficiently startling
to determine him to judge for himself. He shook
off his abstraction long enough to discover that his
old friend was not very far wrong, and once assured
of the fact, he fell into his usual reverie before
coming to any definite decision. He had sufficient
practical wisdom to keep his own counsel about his
original plan, and he reflected upon Celina’s incorrigible
timidity—the many little troubles which matrimony
is apt to bring around one—his own bachelor
comforts—and, above all, his inviolable <span style='font-size:smaller'>SECRET</span>,
until he was quite disposed to believe that it was
“all for the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Waldie’s fifty-fifth birth-day was celebrated by
a wedding; but Mr. Waldie still enjoyed his celibacy
and his secret. Celina became the wife of Willington
Merwyn. At the request of the eccentric
but kind bachelor, the happy pair took up their abode
with him. He probably did not gain much in the
way of quiet by this arrangement, for in the course
of a few years a certain little rosy-cheeked De
Courcy and his chubby sister started the decorous
echoes of the old house with the sounds of baby-grief
and baby-joy. However, there is a wonderful
power of adaptation in the human mind, and Mr.
Waldie learned, after a while, to allow them free ingress
to his student’s den, while he often neglected
his speculative theories for practical illustrations of
kindly affections. Celina made quite as good a wife
as if she had been brought up in the usual lady-like
ignorance of science. She shaped and sewed her
children’s garments, concocted puddings and pies,
directed the mechanism of her household, and was
quite as useful in her sphere as the most vehement
declaimer against <span class='it'>learned women</span> could have deemed
necessary to vindicate her character. Mr. Waldie
never regretted the result of his experiment. He
lived in perfect harmony and peace with his now enlarged
family, and it was not until Celina had become
a comely matron and her children had grown
up to love and reverence him, that the old man was
gathered to his fathers. But his secret had been discovered
long before his death, for he gradually lost
his little personal vanity as soon as he finally concluded
to remain a bachelor, and he did not find any
decrease in Celina’s affection even when she learned
that <span class='it'>he wore</span> <span style='font-size:smaller'>A WIG</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY E. S. GOULD, ESQ. OF NEW YORK.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Bradford sat musing by the window and
was apparently lost in thought, when a sudden knock
at his door aroused him; but before he could bid
the applicant enter, Fred Stanley burst into the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all arranged, Harry,” said he with a glee in
which, however, his companion did not seem at all
to participate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I supposed,” replied Harry, quietly; “such
an affair is not likely to remain long unfinished in
your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why should it, pray?” inquired Stanley, a
little nettled at his friend’s want of enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it should not, of course,” said Harry; “such
matters, after all, are best done when soonest done.
Where do we meet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the old battle-ground—Weehawken,” said
Stanley; “no place like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, none like it, indeed! What time have you
appointed?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, at sunrise,” replied Stanley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s rather prompt, too,” said Harry, “if one
has to take leave of his friends and make his peace
with God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” said Stanley, slightingly, “we must not
think too much of these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> must not, certainly,” replied Harry, “if I would
just now retain my self-possession. We use pistols,
I presume?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, at ten paces;” said Stanley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fearful proximity for men of approved courage
and skill who are bent on taking each other’s life!”
rejoined Harry; then after a pause, he added, “Wilson
persists in his challenge, Fred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good G—!” exclaimed Stanley in dismay at
what appeared to him a prospect of losing his expected
sport, “you are not afraid to meet him Harry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Stanley,” said Harry, “not in your sense of
the word. So long as consequences are limited to
myself, I have little thought of fear. But,” he continued—and
he spoke in a low tone and with unwonted
rapidity, lest some tremulousness of the voice
might betray his emotion—“there are other interests,
other fears, other considerations—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget them for heaven’s sake, until after to-morrow,”
said Stanley, interrupting him, “or you
will never acquit yourself with honor. If you have
any little affairs to despatch, set about them at once,
and don’t fail to be abed and asleep before ten,
or you won’t be up in season. I would not have
Wilson on the ground before us for the world. Good-bye;
I must prepare my pistols, for I see you will
never give them a thought;” and away went Fred
Stanley as full of bravery, as solicitous for his friend’s
honor, and as indifferent about his friend’s distress of
mind—as seconds are wont to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry did not move for some minutes after Stanley
left him; and when at length he raised his eyes from
the floor, his countenance bore an expression of unutterable
wo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no wonder. He was the only child of a
widowed mother, and the affianced lover of the
sweetest maid in the land. If he should fall, as he
well might, what would become of that mother and
of Kate Birney?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He at length aroused himself saying—“I dare not
see my mother: but Kate—dearest, loveliest Kate!
I promised to call on her at five; and it’s five now;
and, by heaven, there she stands at her parlor window
beckoning me to hasten; yes! and she holds up that
bouquet of flowers. It was but yesterday I gathered
them for her—and what has not happened since yesterday!”
Here he paused, as if too much overcome
by fond recollections to proceed: he then added in a
different tone—“these follies come upon us, with
both cause and consequences, as suddenly, as fatally
as the inevitable casualties of life! A day of promise
is changed to a life of mourning by the event of a
moment; the act of an instant destroys the happiness
and poisons the memory of years! Those flowers
were gathered in hope; and before they—frail, perishing
mementos—can wither, he who bound them
and she who wears them may be lost in despair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a heavy heart Harry repaired to his love’s
rendezvous, where, full of beauty and tenderness,
Kate awaited him. They were to be married in a
week; and these interviews of the lovers now possessed
an additional witchery from the fact that their
communings, as lovers, were so soon to terminate
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The romance of passion is a bright episode in our
youth. The hymenæal sun, while he yet clambers
toward the “misty mountain-tops” on the morning
of a wedding-day, spreads his promise over the broad
firmament in a thousand fantastical images of crimson
and gold. We watch the accumulating splendors of
the sky and say, exultingly, if the dawn be so gorgeous
what will not the day bring forth? But as we
gaze, the sun heaves his broad disk above the horizon—the
ephemeral imagery of vapor disappears—and
the calm, steady sunlight of every day-life succeeds
to the beautiful vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Kate, this glowing blazonry of heaven was now
at its culminating point; but Harry felt, as he almost
reluctantly approached her, that a cloud—the more
terrible from his uncertainty as to its dimensions and
progress—was gathering on that glorious sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he approached, his lovely mistress hailed him
with an arch reproof for his delay; but when she
reached out her hand to welcome him, she saw that
his face was flushed and his eye disturbed; and,
changing her tone of censure to one of solicitude,
she inquired anxiously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ill, Harry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pressure of the hand—the eager look of inquiry—the
tremulous tone of affection which accompanied
these few words startled Harry from his self-possession;
and he replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—not at all ill; I—I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry! dear Harry!” exclaimed Kate with
passionate earnestness, “what has happened? Tell
me, Harry! tell me <span class='it'>all</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was instantly obvious to the young man that his
engagement for the morning—which he held himself
bound in honor to fulfil—would in some way certainly
be interfered with by his mistress, if he allowed her
to be informed of it; for, whatever might be his
notions of chivalric obligations, and however imperiously
he might demand her acquiescence in them, he
still knew that a dread of personal danger to himself
would overbear, in her mind, <span class='it'>all</span> other considerations.
He, therefore, felt it necessary to equivocate and
deceive her. This train of argument, which of
course went through his mind in far less time than
is required to note it down, resulted in his saying
promptly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For heaven’s sake, Kate, don’t alarm yourself in
this manner! Nothing has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not to be supposed that this reply was altogether
satisfactory, but as Harry, in his attempt to
mislead Kate had broken the spell of his own forebodings,
he was now able to regain his self command;
and he then soon succeeded in making a jest
of her fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an interview such as lovers know how to
protract and no one knows how to describe, they
parted; Kate inspired with bright visions of happiness,
and Harry, in a state of wretchedness, the nature,
but not the extent, of which may be readily conceived.
He hurried to his room and without any
preparation for the morrow cast himself on the bed
where his agony found poor relief in a fit of uncontrollable
weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this condition, he fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It often happens, by some strange contrariety of
nature, that our dreams have relation to the subjects
<span class='it'>not</span> nearest our hearts: what has occupied our
thoughts during the day usually gives place, in sleep,
to something of more remote interest—as if the soul,
when momentarily disencumbered of the cares of
life, shook off its dependence on the body and pursued
the bent of its own fancy, regardless of the wants
and woes of this tabernacle of day to which it is
ordinarily held in subjection. But Harry’s experience
did not, at this time, conform to the rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had slept awhile, he dreamed that he was
hurrying, stealthily and alone, to the scene of mortal
strife. A little in advance of him was an old man
whom he had several times tried to avoid by changing
his route, but the stranger, without appearing to
be conscious of Harry’s motions, happened so exactly
to regulate his course by that which Harry
took, that the impatient youth found it necessary to
brush past him, at the risk of being interrupted, if
he would reach his destination in due season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had just overtaken the old man, and was rapidly
striding onward, when the latter, with a promptness
and vigor not to be expected in one of his years,
grasped Harry’s arm, saying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold a moment, young man; you are Harry
Bradford, I believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is my name, old gentleman,” replied Harry,
with a stare of astonishment, “but as I have not the
pleasure of knowing you, I must beg you to defer
your civilities. I am in haste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay a moment, nevertheless,” continued the
stranger, “or,”—seeing Harry about to move on
in spite of him—“if you will not, at least walk
slower, that I may accompany you. I knew your
father, Harry, and I can surely claim of his son the
privilege of a parting word just as he is about to rush
unbidden into eternity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you, then, and what would you say?”
exclaimed Harry, not a little startled to find that his
purpose as well as his name was known to the
stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am your friend,” replied the old man, “and my
name is Common Sense. Why are you determined
to throw away your life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said Harry, “I am engaged in an affair of
honor—a matter with which, I fancy, you can have
no concern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have little to do with honor as young men understand
it; but I am desirous to serve you. Tell
me, therefore, what is your predicament?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quondam friend and rival lover, jealous of my
success with a lady, insinuated something to her prejudice
in the presence of gentlemen. I struck him.
He challenged me; and I am bound to fight him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The laws of honor accord full satisfaction to an
injured person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he injured?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not in fact: he merely received a just chastisement
for a wanton insult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says, then, that he is injured?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is it one of the articles of your code of honor
that a party to a quarrel is entitled, also, to be a judge
of his own case?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is immaterial. If a man chooses to consider
himself aggrieved, he can demand an apology,
or, personal satisfaction. The apology being refused—as
in my case it must be—the challenge ensues:
and to question his right to issue it, provided he
is recognised as a gentleman, is, equally with a
refusal to fight, equivalent to an admission of cowardice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An admission of one’s own cowardice is, truly,
no alluring alternative. But let us understand each
other: what sort of cowardice do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know of but one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! Cowardice, speaking generally, is fear:
what fear does a man betray who declines to accept
a challenge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fear—eh—that is—the fear of being shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death, young gentleman, to one who believes in
a future state of reward and punishment, is a solemn
event; and I apprehend that a brave man, or a good
man (to say nothing of a bad man) may fear to meet
it without suffering the imputation of cowardice: so
that, thus far, your position is none of the strongest.
Does this cowardice comprehend nothing else than
the fear of death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we have all the argument on that side of
the question. Let us look a moment at the other.
What induces a man to accept a challenge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fear of dishonor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay? then <span class='it'>fear</span> operates on both horns of the
dilemma: and, for my own part, if I were forced to
act under the dictation of fear, I would choose that
course which promised the least disastrous result.
But here, again, we do not perhaps understand each
other. What kind of <span class='it'>dishonor</span> is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disgrace, in an intolerable form! A man thus
degraded would be driven from society, branded with
the stigma of cowardice, and blasted with the scorn
of all honorable men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, truly, were a fate to be deprecated; though
a man of sober judgment might urge that even such
a fate is nothing compared to what awaits those who
throw themselves, uncalled and unprepared, into the
presence of their Maker. But is what you say <span class='it'>true</span>?
Does such dishonor involve such consequences?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unquestionably it does!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop a moment. Let us consider this. You say
the man would be driven from society: tell me, by
whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By public opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the same agent would brand him a coward
and blast him with universal scorn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This public opinion, I take it, is the united opinion
of that class whom you designate by the phrase <span class='it'>all
honorable men</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. I wish now to ascertain the practical
operation of public opinion. Supposing you were
this dishonored individual: who, as the Scripture
hath it, would cast the first stone at you? Who
would take the initiative in banishing, branding and
scorning you—would your father have done it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, certainly not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would the lady you love—or <span class='it'>any</span> lady on the
face of the earth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would any of the old respectable inhabitants—your
father’s companions and equals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would any of those who, by common consent,
form the respectable and estimable portion of the
community?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would not, rather, all these to whom I have
referred, applaud you for refusing deliberately to
give or receive a death-wound in a quarrel; and
honor you for daring to <span class='it'>practice</span> what every sensible
man has <span class='it'>preached</span> since the world began?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they might.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then will you tell me, identically, <span class='it'>who</span> would
inflict on you the penalties of this imaginary dishonor?
<span class='it'>Who</span> would pronounce you disgraced and
point at you as a coward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Wilson, and Fred Stanly, and Jack Smith,
and Jim Brown, and every body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is a gentleman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One who has, or had, or expects to have a plenty
of cash—who has no particular vocation—who carries
a rattan, wears long hair, and goes to all the
fashionable parties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have but two questions more to ask: supposing
you are killed in this duel: what would be the consequences
<span class='it'>to others</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother would die of a broken heart; and
Kate—God knows what would become of her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing, on the contrary, you should kill your
antagonist?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were not arrested and hanged according to
law, I should be obliged to quit the country and bear,
ever, in my bosom the remorse and on my brow the
mark of a murderer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing more: are you not heartily ashamed
of your present purpose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Harry could reply, Stanley stood at his side
and awakened him by saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Harry, you will be too late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brotherly, disinterested zeal of a second is
worthy of all admiration. How dispassionately he
tries the flint! How coolly he squints along the barrel
to ascertain if the sight is in order! How carefully
he graduates the powder, and with what a
touching connoisseurship he chooses a ball! Observe,
too, with what a stately air he paces off the
ground—from the pride of his step you might imagine
he was a prince or a conqueror marching to receive
the reward of his greatness!—God in heaven! is that
man arranging the ground where his friend is to be
shot—shot in cold blood—and he, a silent, premeditating
witness of the deed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the hour designated, the parties were all in attendance:
the ground was measured and the pistols
were loaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry now interrupted the proceedings saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen this affair has gone far enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too late now, sir!” said Wilson’s second,
haughtily: “my friend refuses to accept an apology.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had better wait,” said Harry, “until I offer
it. I accepted his challenge under a misapprehension
of my obligations to my friends, to society, and
to what are called the laws of honor. I now retract
that acceptance. He insulted me and I struck him;
the reckoning of revenge was thus closed as soon as
it was opened. If he dares to repeat the offence, I
shall repeat the punishment; without holding myself
liable to be shot at like a wild beast of the forest.
You are all welcome to put your own interpretation
on my refusal to fight. My conduct will <span class='it'>justify itself</span>
to all those whose opinions are truly worthy of
regard; and as for the bullying denunciation of those
few miscreants whose highest ambition is to be
known as the lamp-lighters and candle-snuffers of
mortal combats—combats which the laws of God
and man pronounce to be murder—as for their
denunciation, my now wishing you a good morning
shows how thoroughly I despise it.”</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>Was Harry Bradford a sensible man or a fool?
Did he, in after years, regret his refusal to fight a
duel? And will anyone who reads this have the
good sense and manliness to do likewise?</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Ah, sad for thee! when life’s frail thread was shorn,</p>
<p class='line0'>Few near thee wept, though many liv’d to mourn.</p>
<p class='line0'>No arm was there to stay the savage deed,</p>
<p class='line0'>That left thy form with gory wounds to bleed.</p>

<p class='line0'>In death’s cold sleep thy beauty to resign⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>No hearse-drawn train, with mournful steps and slow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was nigh to yield the accustomed signs of woe,</p>

<p class='line0'>When Nature’s arms embrac’d thee in decay,</p>
<p class='line0'>While duteous there a remnant of the brave,</p>
<p class='line0'>Bent o’er thy dust, and form’d thy humble grave,</p>
<p class='line0'>And ’neath the pine-tree’s unfrequented shade,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lone and compos’d thy blood-stain’d relics laid,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “CRUIZING IN THE LAST WAR,” “THE REEFER OF ’76,” ETC. ETC.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE PIRATE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tropical night. The moon had gone down,
but the stars shone clear and lustrous, with a brilliancy
unknown to more temperate climes, painting
a myriad of silvery lines along the smooth swell of
the sleeping ocean. A light breeze was murmuring
across the waters, now and then rippling the waves
in the starlight, and flapping the reef-points occasionally
against the sails. A heavy dew was falling,
bringing with it, from the island that lay far up to
windward, a thousand spicy odors mingled into one
delicious perfume. On the extreme verge of the horizon
hung a misty veil, shrouding the sea-board in
obscurity. Up to windward the same delicate gauze-like
vapor was perceptible, and the position of the
island which we had made at twilight, was only to
be told from the denser masses of mist, that had
gathered in one particular spot on the horizon in
that quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning watch and I was standing,
wrapped up in my monkey jacket, looking out dreamingly
on the ripples that played under our side in the
starlight, when the bluff voice of the boatswain addressed
me, at the same time that the old fellow
wrung an enormous piece of tobacco from a still
larger mass that he held in his brawny hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A still night, Mr. Cavendish,” began Hinton—“it
looks as if the old salt-lake was dreaming, and
had drawn around her that fog as a sort of curtain
to keep herself quiet, as I’ve heard King George and
other big folks do when they go to sleep. For my
part I’ve no notion of such sort of sleeping, for I’d
stifle to death if I had to be wrapt in every night like
the Egyptian mummies that I’ve seen up the straits.
Give me a hammock for sleeping comfortable like
in—I never slept out of one since I went to sea but
once, and then I’d as lief have slept head downwards,
for I didn’t get a wink all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to say that you tried to sleep,” said I
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly—I’m no scollard, and none the worse
for that I think. Them as is born to live by head work
ought to be sent to ’cademies and colleges and such
high places,—but them as have to get a living by
their hands had better leave book-larnin’ alone, for—take
my word for it—it only ends in making them
rascals; and there’s other ways of killing a dog
without choking him to death with bread and butter.
Them’s my sentiments, and so when I’ve got to
speak, instead of skulking about the business in
search of big words, like the cook in the galley, I
come out at once in the plain style my fathers taught
me. The devil fly away with them that can’t speak
without shaking in their shoes lest they make a mistake.
What’s not to be expected of them can’t be, and
big words don’t make an honest man much less a
good boatswain—the proof of the pudding is in the
chewing,” and the old fellow paused and looked in
my face for a reply. He had scarcely done so when
he started, looked around and turned as pale as
ashes. A low melancholy strain, seeming to pervade
the air, and coming now from above and now from
some other quarter, could be distinctly heard rising
solemnly across the night. The phenomenon baffled
even myself, but on Hinton it had an extraordinary
effect. Sailors are at all times superstitious, and the
bluff boatswain possessed a large share of this faculty.
These singular sounds, therefore, appealed
to one of the strongest feelings in his bosom. He
looked at me doubtingly, turned around on tip-toe,
and listened attentively a moment in every direction.
His scrutiny did not satisfy him, but rather increased
his wonder. There could be no doubt that
the sounds existed in reality, for although they died
away for a moment now and then, they would almost
instantly be heard again, apparently coming from a
different quarter of the horizon. The burden of
the strain could not indeed be distinguished, but I
fancied I could recognize human voices in it,
although I was forced to confess that I had never
heard from mortal lips such exquisite melody, for as
the strain rose and fell across the night, now swelling
out clear and full as if sung almost at our ears,
and then melting away in the distance until it died
off like the faintest breathing of a wind-harp, I was
tempted almost to attribute the music to angelic visitants.
The old boatswain seemed to assign the
sounds to the same cause, for drawing nearer to my
side, he ran his eye cautiously and as if in awe, up
to the mast-head; and then looked with a blank and
puzzled gaze, in which, perhaps, some supernatural
fear might be detected, into my face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My own astonishment, however, was but momentary.
Hastily scanning the horizon, I had noticed
that the mist in the direction of the island had been,
during the fifteen minutes that I had been idly looking
over the ship’s side, slowly creeping up towards
us, although in every other direction, except down
in the extreme distance, the sky was as clear as before.
At first moreover my imagination had yielded
to the impression that, as the strain died away on the
night, it came out again from a different quarter
of the horizon; but when, divesting myself of the
momentary influence of my fancy, I began to analyze
the causes of this phenomenon I became satisfied that
the sounds in reality arose out of the bank of clouds,
to windward, and the illusion had been produced by
the rising and falling of the strain upon the night.
When therefore, the old boatswain turned to me with
his baffled look, I had made up my mind as to the
real causes of that which puzzled the veteran seaman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a craft up yonder in that fog,” I said,
pointing to windward, “and there are women on
board, for the voices we hear are too sweet for those
of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said this with a calm smile, which at once dissipated
the fear of my companion, for after thinking a
moment in silence, the puzzled expression of his face
gradually cleared away, and he replied with a low
laugh, which I thought, notwithstanding, a little
forced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right—and that’s a reason for book-larnin
I never thought of before. Here have I sailed
for a matter of forty years or so, and yet I couldn’t
exactly come at the cause of them same sounds,
when you, who havn’t been ten years on the water,—though
you’re a smart sailor, I must say, for your
years—can tell at once all about it, just because
you’ve had a riggilar eddication. Book-larnin ain’t
to be despised arter all,” he continued shaking his
head, “even for a boatswain, and, by the blessing of
God, I’ll borrow the good book of the parson, to-morrow,
and go at it myself; for when I was a youngster
I could spell, I calculate, at the rate of a ten knot
breeze. But mayhap,” he continued, his thoughts
suddenly changing, “that craft up yonder may turn
out a fat prize—we could soon overhaul her if the
wind would only breeze up a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind, however, had now fallen to a dead calm
and the sails hung idly from the masts, while the
ship rolled with a scarce perceptible motion upon the
quiet sea. A current was setting in however, to the
island, and we were thus gradually borne nearer to
the unseen craft. This soon became evident from
the greater distinctness of the sounds, and at length
I thought I could distinguish a few of the words sung,
which seemed to be those of a Spanish air. As the
night advanced the music ceased; but the silence
did not long continue. Suddenly a shriek was heard
rising fearfully on the air, followed by a strange
mixture of noises, as if oaths, groans and entreaties,
and even sounds of mortal strife were all mingled in
one fearful discord. The shriek was now repeated,
with even more fearful vehemence; and then came
the report of a pistol across the darkness. Our hearts
beat with strange feelings. What nefarious deeds
were being done on board the unseen craft? Hitherto
the captain, who had strolled on deck to enjoy
the music, had said that he should await the dawn,
or at least the appearance of a breeze, before overhauling
the stranger, but now he came to the determination
of ordering out the boats, and learning the
cause of those fearful outcries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some hellish work, I fear,” he said, “is going on
yonder; perhaps a piratical boat has boarded the craft,
for the villains infest these islands. Board her at
every risk, and then no mercy to the fiends if they
are really at their work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boats were hastily lowered, manned and
shoved off from the side of the ship. The second
lieutenant commanded one of the boats, and to me
was deputed the charge of the other. We proceeded
rapidly and as noiselessly as possible, into the bank
of clouds and soon lost sight of <span class='sc'>The Arrow</span>, although
long after her hull and spars had disappeared in the
obscurity, her top-light was to be seen like a red
baneful star, floating in the firmament. Our guide
meanwhile, was the sounds of strife on board the
invisible craft, but as we proceeded, the uproar died
away, and for a few moments a profound silence
reigned. Then came a few sullen plunges in the
water which we were at no loss to understand. The
men sprung to their oars with renewed vigor at the
sounds. A perfect stillness reigned once more, but
we knew, from the distinctness with which we had
heard the plunges, that we were close on to the craft.
Steering in the direction therefore, from which the
sounds had come, we glided along the smooth surface
of the sea with almost incredible velocity. Not a word
was spoken, but the oarsmen strained their sinews
to the utmost, while the officers gazed intently into
the gloom ahead. Each moment seemed an age.
Scarcely a dozen more strokes of the oar had been
given, however, when the outlines of a brig shot up,
as if by magic, out of the mist ahead, and almost instantaneously
a voice from the stranger hailed us in
the Spanish tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep her to it my lads—pull with a will,” I said,
as the boat commanded by the lieutenant dashed on
without heeding the hail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boats ahoy!” shouted another voice from the
brig, and this time the words were in English, “lay
on your oars or we’ll fire into you,” and at the same
time a score of heads was faintly seen crowding the
bulwarks of the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dash into her my brave lads!” exclaimed the
lieutenant, standing up in the stern-sheets and waving
his sword aloft, “another pull and we are up to
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men cheered in reply, and, with a jerk that
made the ash blades bend like willow wands, we
shot up to the sides of the brig. But not unopposed;
for almost before the lieutenant had ceased speaking,
the dark villains crowding the sides of the brig poured
in a rattling fire on us that would have checked men
in the pursuit of a less holy object. But the character
of the assassins who had taken the brig had
now become apparent, and every man of our crew,
remembering that agonizing shriek, thirsted to avenge
the sufferer. The volley of the pirates was not,
however, as deadly as it might have been had they
not been taken partially by surprise; and been in
consequence, without that preparation to meet us
which they otherwise would have shown. Their
discharge however—God knows!—was deadly
enough. The stroke oarsman, but a few feet in
advance of me, fell dead across the thwart. But the
other boat, being in advance, suffered far more, for I
saw several of the men stagger in their places,—while
the lieutenant, springing up like a deer, tumbled
headlong into the stern-sheets. He had been shot
through the heart. The impetus, however, which the
last gigantic stroke of the men had given to the boats
sent them onwards to the brig, and we struck her side
almost instantaneously with the fall of my superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vengeance,” I shouted, “vengeance my lads!
follow me,” and springing into the forechains of the
brig, I leaped from thence upon her deck, and found
myself, the next moment almost unsupported amidst
a circle of desperate foes. But it was only for a
moment that I was left without aid. I had scarcely
exchanged the first parry with a brawny desperado
who met me at the bulwark, when my gallant fellows
came pouring in after me, inflamed to double fury
by the loss we had suffered, and betokening by their
stern determined looks that the approaching conflict
was to be one of extermination or death. The pirates,
seemingly aware of their situation, glared on us with
the fury of wild-beasts, and sprang with curses and
yells to repel the boarders. This left me, for the
instant, almost alone with my stalwart opponent, and
had my cause been less righteous, or my skill at my
weapon not a proverb, I should have trembled for
my life. Barely indeed have I seen a finer looking
or more muscular man than my opponent on that
fatal night. He was a tall sinewy Spaniard, of the
pure olive complexion, with a dark, glittering, fearful
eye, and a huge black mustache such as I never saw
on a man before or since. His head was bare, with
the exception of a red scarf which was bound around
it in the form of a turban, the ends of which depended
on the left side, as I have sometimes seen them fancifully
arranged by the creole girls of the islands.
His shirt collar was thrown open, displaying a broad
and brawny chest that would have served as a model
for that of an athlete. His arms were bared to above
the elbow, and in his hand he held a common cutlass;
but a brace of huge silver mounted pistols, and a
dagger with a splendidly ornamented hilt were thrust
into the scarf he wore around his waist. I forgot to
mention that a small cross, the jewels of which
sparkled even in the comparative darkness, depended
by a rich gold chain from his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am able to give this description of him, because
when we found ourselves left almost alone, we
paused a moment, as men engaged in a deadly single
combat will often do, before commencing our strife.
I suspected at once that I was opposed to the leader
of the pirates, and he seemed to feel that I held the
same office among the assailants, for he gazed at me
a moment, with a kind of proud satisfaction, which,
however, settled down, as his eye took in my comparatively
slight proportions, to an expression of
sneering scorn. Our pause, although sufficiently long
for me to observe all this, endured but for an instant,
for the momentary admiration of my foe faded before
that sneering expression, and making a blow at
him with my cutlass, which he dexterously repelled,
we were soon engaged in mortal combat. At first
my opponent underrated my powers, but a wound,
which I gave him in the arm, seemed to convince
him that victory would cost him an effort, and he became
more wary. For several moments the conflict
was only a rapid exchange of passes, during which
our blades rattled and flashed incessantly; for
neither of us could obtain the slightest advantage
over the other. How the combatants progressed
during this interval I neither knew nor cared to ascertain,
for so intensely was I engrossed in my duel
with the pirate-leader that I heard nothing but the
ringing of our blades, and saw only the glittering
eye of my opponent. Those only who have been
engaged in a deadly strife can understand the feelings
of one in such a situation. Every faculty is engrossed
in the struggle—the very heart seems to
stand still, awaiting the end. The hand involuntarily
follows the impulse of the mind, and the eye
never loses sight of that of its destined victim. The
combat had continued for several minutes, when I
saw that the pirate was beginning to grow chafed,
for the calm, collected expression of his eye gave
place gradually to one of fury, and his lunges were
made with inconceivable rapidity, and with a daring
amounting to rashness. It took all my skill to protect
myself, and I was forced at length to give
ground. The eye of the pirate glared at his success
like that of a wild beast already sure of its prey, and,
becoming even more venturesome, he pressed forward
and made a pass at me which I avoided with
difficulty, and then only partially, for the keen blade,
although averted from my heart, glanced sideways,
and penetrating my arm inflicted a fearful wound.
But at the time I was insensible of the injury. I felt
the wound no more than if a pin had pierced me.
Every thought and feeling was engrossed by the
now defenceless front of my antagonist, for, as he
lunged forward with his blade, he lost his defence
and his bosom lay unguarded before me. Quick as
lightning I shortened my blade and prepared to
plunge it into the heart of the pirate. He saw his
error and made an attempt to grasp a pistol with his
left hand, to ward off the blow with his sword arm.
But it was in vain. With one desperate effort I drove
my blade inwards—it cut through and through his
half opposed defence—and with a dull heavy sound
went to his very heart. His eyes glared an instant
more wildly than ever—his lips opened, but the faint
cry was stifled ere it was half uttered—a quick,
shuddering, convulsive movement passed over his
face and through his frame, and, as I drew out the
glittering blade, now red with the life blood of one
who, a moment before, had been in full existence,
the pirate fell back dead upon the deck. At the
same moment I heard a hearty cheer, and looking
around, I saw that our brave fellows had gained a
footing on the deck, and were driving the pirates
backwards towards the stern of the vessel. I now,
for the first time, felt the pain of my wound. But
hastily snatching the scarf from the body of my late
opponent, I managed to bandage my arm so as partially
to stop the blood, and hurried to head my gallant
tars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this had not occupied three minutes, so rapid
are the events of a mortal combat. I had at first
thought that we had been forgotten in the excitement
of the strife, but I had not been wholly unobserved,
for as I stooped to snatch the scarf of the
pirate, one of his followers who had seen him fall,
levelled a pistol at me with a curse, but the missile
was struck up by one of my men, just as it was discharged,
and the ball lodged itself harmlessly in the
bulwark beside me. In another instant I was again
in the midst of the fight. The red scarf which I wore
however, reminding the pirates of the death of their
leader, called down on me their revenge, and my
appearance in the strife was a signal for a general
rush upon me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down with him,” roared a tall swarthy assassin,
who, from his tone of authority, I judged to be the
second in command, “cut him down—revenge! revenge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was at that moment surrounded on two sides by
the pirates, but springing back while my gallant tars
raised their blades in an arch over me, I escaped the
cutlasses of the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurl the hell-hounds to perdition,” growled a
veteran fore-top-man, as he dashed at the piratical
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand fast, all—life or death—that for your vengeance,”
was the response of the foe as he levelled
a pistol at the breast of the gallant seaman. The
ball sped on its errand, and the top man fell at my
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My men were now infuriated beyond all control.
They dashed forward, like a torrent, sweeping every
thing before them. The pirates, headed by their
leader, made one or two desperate efforts to maintain
their ground, but the impetuosity of their antagonists
was irresistable, and the desperadoes, at first sullenly
giving way, at length were forced into an indiscriminate
retreat. A few of the most daring of the
freebooters, however, refused to yield an inch and
were cut down; while others, after flying a few
paces, turned and died at bay; but with the mass the
love of immediate life triumphed over the fear of an
ultimate ignominious death, and they retreated to the
fore-hatch, down which they were driven. A few
attempted to regain the long crank boat in which they
had attacked the brig from the island, but their design
was anticipated by one of our fellows who hove
a brace of shot through her bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now bethought me of the female whose shriek
had first alarmed us; and, advancing to the cabin, I
descended with a trembling heart, anxious and yet
fearing to learn the truth. I have faced death in a
hundred forms—in storm, in battle, and amidst epidemics,
but my nerves never trembled before or
since as they did when I opened the door into the
cabin. What a sight was there! Extended on the
floor lay a white-haired old man, with a huge gash
in his forehead, and his long silvery locks dabbled in
his own gore. At his side, in a state of grief approaching
to stupefaction, sat, or rather knelt, a lovely
young creature who might be about seventeen, her
long golden tresses dishevelled on her snowy shoulders,
and her blue eyes gazing with a dry, stony
look upon the face of her dead parent. Both the
daughter and the father were attired with an elegance
which bespoke wealth if not rank. Around
her were several female slaves, filling the cabin with
their lamentations, and, at intervals, vainly endeavoring
to comfort their young mistress. Several books
and a guitar were scattered about, and the whole
apartment, though only the cabin of a common merchant
brig, had an air of feminine grace and neatness.
The sight of the instruments of music almost
brought the tears into my eyes. Alas! little had that
lovely girl imagined, when singing her artless songs,
in what misery another hour would find her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My entrance, however, partially aroused the desolate
girl. She looked up with alarm in every feature,
gazed at me irresolutely a moment, and then
frantically clasping the body of her murdered parent,
shrunk from my approach. The negro women clustered
around her, their lamentations stilled by their
fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are free—thank God!” said I in a voice
husky with emotion, “the murderers of your parent
are avenged!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terrified girl looked at me with an expression
which I shall never forget—an expression in which
agony, joy and doubt were all mingled into one—and
then, pressing the cold body of that old man close to
her bosom, she burst into a flood of tears; while her
slaves, reassured by my words, resumed their noisy
grief. I knew that the tears of the agonised daughter
would relieve her grief, and respecting the sacredness
of her sorrow, I withdrew to the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, one of the crew of the brig who had
managed to secrete himself from the pirates, and had
thus escaped the massacre which befell indiscriminately
his messmates, had come forth from his hiding
place, and related the story of their capture. I will
give it, adding other matters in their place, as I
learnt them subsequently from the inmates of the
cabin. The brig was a coaster, and had left the
Havanna a few days before, having for passengers
an English gentleman of large fortune with his
daughter and her personal slaves. They had been
becalmed the preceding evening under the lee of
the neighboring island, and, as the night was a fine
one, their passengers had remained on deck until a
late hour, the daughter of Mr. Neville amusing herself
with singing on her own guitar, or listening to
the ruder but yet dulcet music of her slaves. At
length they had descended to the cabin, but, within
a few minutes of their retirement, a large crank boat,
pulled by some twenty armed piratical ruffians, had
been seen coming towards the brig. Escape was
impossible, and defence was useless. The feeble
though desperate resistance made by the crew of a
half dozen men, was soon overcome. Mr. Neville
had headed the combat, and, when the ruffians gained
possession of the deck, had retreated to the cabin,
barricading the entrance on the inside. But the
pirates, headed by their leader, although baffled for
a while, had eventually broke through this defence
and poured into the cabin; but not until several
of their number had been wounded by the desperate
parent, who, fighting like a lion at bay, had even
fired through the door on his assailants, after they
had shattered it and before it was finally broken in.
At length the ruffians had gained an entrance; and
a dozen swords were levelled at Mr. Neville, who
still endeavored to shield his daughter. He fell—and
God knows what would have been the fate of that
innocent girl, if we had not at the instant reached the
brig. The ruffian leader was forced to leave his
prey and hasten on deck. The reader knows the
rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When morning dawned we were still abreast of
the island. By this time, however, a light breeze had
sprung up and the schooner had been brought to under
the quarter of <span class='sc'>The Arrow</span>. My superior heard with
emotion of the death of his lieutenant, and expressed
his determination of carrying the pirates into the
neighboring port at once, and delivering them up for
trial. He gave up his own cabin temporarily to the
afflicted daughter, and sympathized with her sorrow
as if she had been his own child. The remains of
her parent were not consigned to the deep, but
allotted, on the following day, a place in consecrated
ground. But I pass over the events immediately
succeeding the capture of the pirates. Suffice it to
say that, after a delay of three or four days in port,
we found it would be impossible to have the pirates
brought to trial by the tardy authorities under a
month. As my presence was deemed necessary on
that event, and as my superior was unwilling to delay
his cruise for so long a period, it was determined
then that <span class='sc'>The Arrow</span> should pursue her voyage,
calling again at the port to take me up in the course
of a month or six weeks. The next day, after this
arrangement, she sailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A still more important scene than that which we
have described in Lady Jane Seymour’s chamber
was passing in the Lord Protector’s closet. A portion
of those noblemen forming his council had been
hastily summoned to assist in the examination of
Lord Dudley, who was brought up from his prison in
the new and damp rooms, near the Strand, where
he had spent a night of discomfort, which by no
means reconciled his proud spirit to the degradation
heaped upon it. Though a member, and most powerful
one, of his own council, the Lord Protector had
neglected to summon the Earl of Warwick to the
examination of his son, and Dudley was far too
anxious for a good understanding between his own
father and the family of his betrothed, to solicit his
interference, or even send news of his arrest to the
haughty earl. He dreaded the fiery indignation
with which the intelligence might be received, and
even felt a sensation of relief when he found his
father’s seat vacant at the tribunal before which he
was so ignominiously arraigned. He was sensible
that the Earl of Warwick, as well as the duke, was
willing to avail himself of any excuse which might
terminate the contract existing between himself and
the Lady Jane. His affection for the sweet girl was
both sincere and ardent, and though he felt the insult
offered by her father with the irritation of a
proud, sensitive spirit, he suffered still more deeply
from a consciousness that she was a sharer in his
trouble, and that the proceedings to which he was
an unwilling party were not only a degradation to
his manhood but liable to separate him from the object
of his affections forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these indignant and conflicting feelings the
young nobleman presented himself before the Lord
Protector and the few councillors whom he had
gathered to his assistance—men who seemed but ill
at ease in the position which they held, and were in
truth far more anxious to appease the duke than to
join him in rash measures against a family which
had already rendered itself fearful throughout the
kingdom by the might of its power. The artisan
was there, craven and abject, yet with something of
insolence in his manner; but whether he was brought
forward as a witness or a prisoner the proud young
man did not deign to inquire; under any circumstances
to be so associated was a cruel insult which made
the blood tingle in his veins. It was with a firm lip
and an eye darkling with subdued excitement that
Lord Dudley placed himself before the council table
to be questioned like a criminal by the man he had
loved almost as a father. The duke seemed touched
by some regretful feelings, and a flush came up to
his forehead as he encountered the proud glance
which was bent upon him by the prisoner. At another
time he would have shrunk from mingling the
pure name of his child with an investigation so
strange in its nature—with questions which might
even endanger the honor of his name, but this consideration
was lost in his dislike of the Earl of Warwick—a
man whom he feared and hated almost as
much as he could fear and hate mortal being. Ambition
was the leading characteristic of both—such
ambition as at last rendered their strife for power
like the struggle of two gladiators in mortal combat.
They were bold combatants, and hitherto the strife
had been a quiet and subtle one. Now a kingdom
was looking on. Somerset had sprung into the arena,
struck the first blow, and he was well aware that
his station and power depended on the victory which
he was contending for—that Warwick must be
driven from the council of the nation or himself from
the protectorship. He little knew how still and
subtle had been the windings of his enemy, and with
how deep a triumph he received the news of his
son’s arrest. We have said that Dudley had caught
one glimpse of his betrothed on his way to the council,
and for her sake he condescended to answer,
with haughty calmness, the questions propounded
by her father. His account of the share he had taken
in the St. Margaret’s riot was simple, and given in
few words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had sallied forth, as usual, on his morning ride
with the ordinary number of attendants and without
the most remote suspicion that any disturbance was
threatened. He described the manner in which he
had become entangled with the crowd, but avoided
all mention of the Lady Jane till called upon by her
father to state how she came under his protection.
He explained all about the condition in which he
had found her—the struggle with which she was conducted
through the crowd—their entrance to the
church and every thing that transpired till the poor
girl was exposed to public outrage by the violence
of her own parent. There was truth and dignity in
the young man’s statement, which, against his will,
convinced the duke of his injustice. But he had
already proceeded too far, and he felt that to leave
the charge against his prisoner unsubstantiated was
to make himself still more unpopular with the people,
and fling a fearful power into the hands of his
rival. Family affection, his daughter, everything
was forgotten in the strife to maintain his tottering
power, and though his eye quailed and his brow
crimsoned as he perpetrated the insult, that cringing
artisan was called forward to disprove the solemn
statement of a high born and honorable man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Dudley turned very pale and drew back with
a stern brow and folded arms as the wretch gave his
infamous story. The artisan had enough of low born
cunning to see that any statement, calculated to implicate
the noble youth, would be received as an
atonement for the base fraud which he had committed,
and persisted in the assertions that he had previously
made. When the jewels and the ring were produced
he turned, like a coward hound, from the stern
glance fixed on him by the young noble, but still in a
tone of low bravado, asserted that the ring had been
given by the Lady Jane, and that Lord Dudley had
rewarded his exertions in bringing them together
with the emeralds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Dudley shut his teeth hard and folded his
arms more tightly, as if to repress an impulse to
smite the worm where he stood, but turning his
flashing eyes from the miscreant to the Duke of Somerset
he once more forced himself to composure.
The artisan proceeded to substantiate his evidence
by assertions regarding the manner and words of the
lady, and was going on adding falsehood to falsehood,
when the gentle girl, whom he so cruelly aspersed,
opened the door and glided into the room. She
moved forward to a chair which stood directly in
front of the wretch, and grasping the back with her
hand, stood regarding him with a look of calm and
almost solemn indignation. So noiseless was her
entrance that she had been more than a minute in
the room before those assembled there became conscious
of her presence. As the perjured man lifted
his eyes in uttering a sentence, they met the rebuke
of that calm glance and quailed beneath it. He faltered
in what he was saying and shrunk back to avoid
the frown of her innocent presence. When the duke
saw his child standing before him, her robe hastily girt
round her person, her hair wound in a heavy web over
her head, and her sweet face bearing upon each feature
evidence of late and bitter suffering, he started to his
feet with an exclamation of displeasure and would
have demanded the cause of her intrusion, but the
change which had fallen upon her was so great that
he stood gazing upon her face, lost in a degree of
astonishment that had something of awe in it. He
could scarcely believe that the face so calm, so
pale and resolute, was that of his quiet and child-like
daughter. The fountains of a resolute and noble
heart had been troubled for the first time, and their
overflow left upon her face an expression that never
left it again—the impress of such thoughts and
feelings as exalt and strengthen the heart they wring.
The Lady Jane had become suddenly capable of acting
for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” she said, turning her large eyes from
the perjurer to his judge, “Father, I have heard
enough to prove how base a thing may be dared even
in the presence of a parent; that man has spoken
falsely, the ring which you hold was taken from my
finger when I lay helpless, and so terrified that I was
almost unconscious of the loss, and only remember
now as in a dream that a strange grasp was on my
hand, a wrench that pained me; then I fainted and
forgot all till my mother spoke of the ring a few
moments since in my chamber. The emeralds my
Lord Duke—” she hesitated a moment and her eyes
filled as if with regret that she had uttered so cold a
tittle, “the emeralds—my father, were not Lord
Dudley’s but my mother’s gift, and I bound my hair
with them yesterday morning when I went forth
according to your command to take the air; they must
have broken loose from my head, for behold here is
a proof that they were my own and not Lord
Dudley’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she spoke the Lady Jane unbound the rich
masses of her hair, which had not been smoothed
since the previous day, and disentangled a fragment
of the emerald band which still sparkled within it.
They were broad smooth gems linked together with
its delicate chain work of gold, and each with
a fanciful device cut upon its surface. One of those
which the duke held, still remained firm in its setting,
a link or two of the chain adhered to it, and those
links corresponded in size and workmanship with
the fragment which Lady Jane had taken from her
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still,” said the Duke of Somerset, willing to exculpate
his daughter, but determined at all hazards
to make good his charge against Dudley, “still does
this in no way clear the prisoner from his participation
in the riot. We saw him with our own eyes
amid the mob, we⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duke broke off suddenly, for as the last words
left his lips, the closet door was flung open and a tall
man, almost regally arrayed, and of imperious presence,
entered the room. He cast one quick glance
at the Lord Protector, from under his eyebrows, and
moving tranquilly to a chair by the council table sat
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, my lord duke; I am rather late, but do not
let my entrance disturb these august proceedings,”
he said, blandly, though there was a slight trembling
of the voice which told how tumultuous were the
passions concealed beneath all that elaborate and
courteous display of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke bowed stiffly, and his face was crimson
to the temples. Lord Dudley grew pale and red by
turns, half disposed to approach his father, and as yet
uncertain that he was aware of the position in which
he was placed before the council. The Lady Jane
trembled visibly and grasped the chair against which
she stood for support, while the councillors looked
in each other’s faces confused and at a loss how to act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this time Warwick sat with his elbow resting
on the table, supporting his chin with the palm of his
bent hand, and gazing with a doubtful smile, quietly
into the duke’s face, as if they had been the best
friends on earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, my lord duke, go on,” he said slightly
waving his right hand, “Pray do not allow my late
and abrupt entrance to interrupt the flow of your
grace’s eloquence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me,” replied the duke, rising from his
seat, “this subject must be a painful one, alike to
your Lordship and myself. We scarcely expected
the Earl of Warwick would choose to meet us in
council this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And therefore did not summon him to the examination
of his son and heir. It was kindly managed, my
lord duke, very kindly; be assured the earl of Warwick
will not forget this delicacy. Nor will the king, whom
I left but now, so deeply impressed with the generous
care which your grace bestows on the honor of my
humble house, that he has summoned such noblemen
of your council as were deemed worthy of the generous
silence with which your grace has honored me,
to meet him at Somerset House, where, with permission,
I will have the pleasure of conducting my
son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was cool and cutting irony in this speech
which would have lashed the exciteable protector
to fury, but for the startling intelligence which it
conveyed, regarding the young king. This so over-powered
him that he sat pale and with gleaming eyes
gazing on the composed and smiling features of the
earl, speechless and for a moment bereft of all presence
of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without seeming to notice the effect his speech
had made on the protector, Warwick arose, threw
back his velvet cloak with a careless toss that exposed
the sable facings, and smoothing the folds over his
shoulder with elaborate care, as if no deeper thought
than that of personal appearance entered his mind,
approached Lord Dudley and taking his arm seemed
about to conduct him from the room without further
ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord of Warwick,” exclaimed Somerset
starting to his feet and suddenly finding voice, “that
young man is a prisoner under arrest for treason, and
shall not leave this presence save with a guard of
armed men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This young man is my prisoner, under the king’s
warrant, and he not only leaves this room without
other guard than his father’s arm, but denies the
right of any man here, to question or retain him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl of Warwick turned as he spoke, and for
the first time that day, all the haughty fire of his soul
burst into the usually quiet but fine black eyes, which
dwelt upon the Lord Protector’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what means this? am I to be braved at
my own council table? I⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl of Somerset broke off, for so intense was
his rage, that words were denied him, and specks of
foam rushed up to his white lips in their place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my lord duke,” replied Warwick, once
more recovering the composure which he seldom
lost, even in moments of the deepest excitement, “not
at your own council table; that no longer exists.
The council of this nation is sitting now at Somerset
House, and <span class='it'>I</span> preside there by a choice of the majority,
and by desire of King Edward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Somerset fell back in his chair as if a
sudden blow had stunned him, and shading his pale
face with his scarcely less pallid hand, remained
motionless and silent. The Lady Jane sprang to his
side, flung her arm around his neck, and as Lord Dudley
broke from the hold which Warwick placed on
his arm, she put him calmly away with her disengaged
hand. Then lifting her face to the earl, she
said, “Your work is done. Leave my father to those
who love him.” For one moment a shade of feeling
swept over Warwick’s face, but it was instantly
banished, and a courteous inclination of the head was
all the reply he made. After a moment he turned to
the few councillors still retaining their seats in silent
consternation, and invited them in the name of King
Edward and their colleagues, sitting at Somerset
House, to join himself and son there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief and whispered consultation
around the board; then all, save one man arose, casting
furtive glances at the fallen protector, as if they were
anxious to escape from his presence unnoticed. The
duke lifted his head, and a smile of mingled bitterness
and pain passed over his pale features as he saw this
movement of his friends. The Lady Jane too,
blanched a little whiter and lifted her large clear eyes
with an expression of painful astonishment, as if her
generous nature could scarcely force itself to believe
the selfishness with which she was surrounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With cringing and noiseless steps, those men
whom Somerset had deemed his true and tried friends,
those that would cling to him through good and
through evil report—had glided from his presence
and stood in the corridor, consulting together in whispers
and waiting anxiously for Warwick to come
forth, that they might offer him their support unchecked
by the presence of the fallen noble to whom, in
his prosperity, they had cringed with servile spirits,
ready to kneel at any shrine which possessed stepping
stones for their own ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One man there was, a gray-haired and frank old
nobleman, poor and proud, of a high name, but dignified
in his poverty, who had never cringed to the protector
or flattered him in the plenitude of his power,
but who put away the hand which his antagonist extended
as he passed round the table and knelt down
by the fallen duke, with a true homage which had
more of feeling in its silence than hours of protestation
could have conveyed. The duke had leaned forward
to the table, and one hand was pressed over
his eyes, the other hung nervelessly by his side, and
the quivering lips of that brave old man—for he was
braver in his moral strength than a thousand battle
heroes, went to his heart. One large tear forced itself
through his fingers, and dashing it away, the
Duke of Somerset arose a more dignified man in his
adversity than he had ever been in prosperity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord of Warwick,” he said, “this is your
hour of triumph—how obtained your own heart can
best reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, your grace’s rashness is my answer,” interrupted
Warwick, with a bland and courteous inclination,
“but I have no time for cavil and recrimination.
The king is waiting, and methinks there has
been enough of high words for a lady’s presence.
Lady Jane, we should all crave pardon for discussing
state affairs in so gentle a presence. Permit my
son to lead you from the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young girl looked up and hesitated, then drawing
nearer to the duke, she said very mildly⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father will permit me to stay. That which
concerns him cannot be improper for his daughter to
witness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earl seemed embarrassed by her refusal, but
after a moment resumed his usual composed manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me,” he said, “if I am compelled to
perform the first duty of my office in a manner which
might have been avoided,” and stepping to the
door, the Earl of Warwick beckoned with his hand
to some persons in the corridor. Instantly three men,
whom Somerset knew, entered the closet, and there
at his own council table, and in the presence of his
child, arrested him for treason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A death-like stillness reigned throughout the room
for the duration of a minute after the warrant was
read. Until this moment Dudley had remained inactive,
confused and uncertain how to interfere in a
scene which seemed passing before him like a wild
dream, but now he stepped forward firmly and with
the air of a man resolved to act from his own honest
impulses at all hazards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord,” he said, addressing his father, “you
will not proceed to such extremities against an old
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Warwick looked in his son’s face, and a slight
sneer curled his lip as he muttered, “old friends, indeed—well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am certain,” resumed Dudley, “your own
honorable heart must revolt at an act so cruel. If
the Duke of Somerset has offended the king let his
majesty find some other person than the Earl of Warwick
to proceed against him, lest those who deem
that there is little of friendly feeling between the
houses of Somerset and Warwick, may impute other
motives than a love of justice to the prosecution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley spoke in a low voice, but every tone fell
upon the anxious ear of Lady Jane, and a flash of
gratified affection, half pride and half tenderness
filled her eyes. For she knew how deep was the
reverence he rendered to the earl, and how much of
moral courage was in the heart which could have
the displeasure of a man so imperative and haughty,
but who had even preserved the affections as well
as the fear of his family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very prettily argued, my clerkly son,” replied
Warwick, lightly—“but pray can you tell me what
the good people of England may think of the nobleman,
who took advantage of his power to cast a son,
and heir of that same ‘old friend’ whom you prate of
into a damp hole in his palace, to herd him with a
cur like that, and drag him before a picked number
of councillors to be examined, on a question which
touched his honor and life itself? Love is a question
to amuse the people more than any act of mine. If
His Grace of Somerset has seen fit to tread upon a
serpent’s nest, the world will not marvel that his foot
is stung where it would have crushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Dudley, no—the king has rightly decided,
and he who would have heaped ignominy on my son
shall drain the cup he has drugged! Even as he
forced the heir to my house to this closet in base
contact with a wretch like that cringing cur yonder,
shall he go forth and in like company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley heard his father out with habitual reverence,
but still opened his lips to expostulate once
more against the course he was pursuing, but Warwick
turned impatiently away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush man,” he said with a quick wave of the
hand, “have done with this and meet me at Somerset
House within the hour. The king desires it. If
your grace is ready,” he added, turning to Somerset
as if extending the most trifling invitation on earth,
“we will proceed at once to the council.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somerset arose, folded a cloak about him, and
though his face was very pale, moved toward the
door without speaking a word. The guard closed in
around him, and he left the closet like one in a bewildering
dream. He had entered that room but an
hour before, arrogant in the consciousness of power,
second to none in the kingdom; he left it a prisoner
and a ruined man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Warwick gave a sign that the artisan should be
secured and followed the fallen duke. The old councillor
kept by the side of his friend, and on their way
through the corridor the Duchess of Somerset came
through a side door and approached her husband, but
seeing how pale he was, and that many persons were
around him, she drew back disappointed in the
womanly impulse which had induced her to seek an
interview before he went from the palace, that the
cause of her child might be justly understood.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Ballads and Other Poems. By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
Author of “Voices of the Night,” “Hyperion,”
&amp;c. Second Edition. John Owen: Cambridge.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In our last number we had some hasty observations on
these “Ballads”—observations which we now propose, in
some measure, to amplify and explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be remembered that, among other points, we demurred
to Mr. Longfellow’s <span class='it'>themes</span>, or rather to their general
character. We found fault with the too obtrusive nature
of their <span class='it'>didacticism</span>. Some years ago we urged a
similar objection to one or two of the longer pieces of
Bryant; and neither time nor reflection has sufficed to modify,
in the slightest particular, our convictions upon this
topic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have said that Mr. Longfellow’s conception of the
<span class='it'>aims</span> of poesy is erroneous; and that thus, laboring at a
disadvantage, he does violent wrong to his own high
powers; and now the question is, what <span class='it'>are</span> his ideas of the
aims of the Muse, as we gather these ideas from the <span class='it'>general</span>
tendency of his poems? It will be at once evident
that, imbued with the peculiar spirit of German song (a
pure conventionality) he regards the inculcation of a <span class='it'>moral</span>
as essential. Here we find it necessary to repeat that we
have reference only to the <span class='it'>general</span> tendency of his compositions;
for there are some magnificent exceptions, where,
as if by accident, he has permitted his genius to get the
better of his conventional prejudice. But didacticism is
the prevalent <span class='it'>tone</span> of his song. His invention, his imagery,
his all, is made subservient to the elucidation of some one
or more points (but rarely of more than one) which he looks
upon as <span class='it'>truth</span>. And that this mode of procedure will find
stern defenders should never excite surprise, so long as the
world is full to overflowing with cant and conventicles.
There are men who will scramble on all fours through the
muddiest sloughs of vice to pick up a single apple of virtue.
There are things called men who, so long as the sun rolls,
will greet with snuffling huzzas every figure that takes upon
itself the semblance of truth, even although the figure, in
itself only a “stuffed Paddy,” be as much out of place as
a toga on the statue of Washington, or out of season as rabbits
in the days of the dog-star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now with as deep a reverence for “the true” as ever
inspired the bosom of mortal man, we would limit, in many
respects, its modes of inculcation. We would limit to enforce
them. We would not render them impotent by dissipation.
The demands of truth are severe. She has no
sympathy with the myrtles. All that is indispensible in
song is all with which she has nothing to do. To deck her
in gay robes is to render her a harlot. It is but making her
a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers.
Even in stating this our present proposition, we verify our
own words—we feel the necessity, in enforcing this <span class='it'>truth</span>,
of descending from metaphor. Let us then be simple and
distinct. To convey “the true” we are required to dismiss
from the attention all inessentials. We must be perspicuous,
precise, terse. We need concentration rather than expansion
of mind. We must be calm, unimpassioned, unexcited—in
a word, we must be in that peculiar mood which,
as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the poetical.
He must be blind indeed who cannot perceive the radical
and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical
modes of inculcation. He must be grossly wedded to
conventionalisms who, in spite of this difference, shall still
attempt to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry
and Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dividing the world of mind into its most obvious and
immediately recognisable distinctions, we have the pure
intellect, taste, and the moral sense. We place <span class='it'>taste</span> between
the intellect and the moral sense, because it is just
this intermediate space which, in the mind, it occupies. It
is the connecting link in the triple chain. It serves to sustain
a mutual intelligence between the extremes. It appertains,
in strict appreciation, to the former, but is distinguished
from the latter by so faint a difference, that Aristotle
has not hesitated to class some of its operations
among the Virtues themselves. But the <span class='it'>offices</span> of the trio
are broadly marked. Just as conscience, or the moral
sense, recognises duty; just as the intellect deals with
<span class='it'>truth</span>; so is it the part of taste alone to inform us of
<span style='font-size:smaller'>BEAUTY</span>. And Poesy is the handmaiden but of Taste. Yet
we would not be misunderstood. This handmaiden is not
forbidden to moralise—in her own fashion. She is not forbidden
to depict—but to reason and preach, of virtue. As,
of this latter, conscience recognises the obligation, so intellect
leaches the expediency, while taste contents herself
with displaying the beauty: waging war with vice merely
on the ground of its inconsistency with fitness, harmony,
proportion—in a word with το καλον.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An important condition of man’s immortal nature is thus,
plainly, the sense of the Beautiful. This it is which ministers
to his delight in the manifold forms and colors and
sounds and sentiments amid which he exists. And, just
as the eyes of Amaryllis are repeated in the mirror, or the
living lily in the lake, so is the mere <span class='it'>record</span> of these forms
and colors and sounds and sentiments—so is their mere oral
or written repetition a duplicate source of delight. But
this repetition is not Poesy. He who shall merely sing
with whatever rapture, in however harmonious strains, or
with however vivid a truth of imitation, of the sights and
sounds which greet him in common with all mankind—he,
we say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is
still a longing unsatisfied, which he has been impotent to
fulfil. There is still a thirst unquenchable, which to allay
he has shown us no crystal springs. This burning thirst
belongs to the <span class='it'>immortal</span> essence of man’s nature. It <span class='it'>is</span>
equally a consequence and an indication of his perennial
life. It is the desire of the moth for the star. It is not
the mere appreciation of the beauty before us. It is a wild
effort to reach the beauty above. It is a forethought of the
loveliness to come. It is a passion to be satiated by no
sublunary sights, or sounds, or sentiments, and the soul
thus athirst strives to allay its fever in futile efforts at
<span class='it'>creation</span>. Inspired with a prescient ecstasy of the beauty
beyond the grave, it struggles by multiform novelty of combination
among the things and thoughts of Time, to anticipate
some portion of that loveliness whose very elements,
perhaps, appertain solely to Eternity. And the result of
such effort, on the part of souls fittingly constituted, is
alone what mankind have agreed to denominate Poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We say this with little fear of contradiction. Yet the
spirit of our assertion must be more heeded than the letter.
Mankind have <span class='it'>seemed</span> to define Poesy in a thousand, and
in a thousand conflicting definitions. But the war is one
only of words. Induction is as well applicable to this subject
as to the most palpable and utilitarian; and by its sober
processes we find that, in respect to compositions which
have been really received as poems, the <span class='it'>imaginative</span>, or,
more popularly, the creative portions <span class='it'>alone</span> have ensured
them to be so received. Yet these works, on account of
these portions, having once been so received and so named,
it has happened, naturally and inevitably, that other portions
totally unpoetic have not only come to be regarded
by the popular voice as poetic, but have been made to serve
as false standards of perfection, in the adjustment of other
poetical claims. Whatever has been found in whatever
has been received as a poem, has been blindly regarded as
<span class='it'>ex statû</span> poetic. And this is a species of gross error which
scarcely could have made its way into any less intangible
topic. In fact that license which appertains to the Muse
herself, it has been thought decorous, if not sagacious to indulge,
in all examination of her character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poesy is thus seen to be a response—unsatisfactory it is
true—but still in some measure a response, to a natural
and irrepressible demand. Man being what he is, the time
could never have been in which Poesy was not. Its first
element is the thirst for supernal <span class='sc'>Beauty</span>—a beauty which
is not afforded the soul by any existing collocation of earth’s
forms—a beauty which, perhaps, <span class='it'>no possible</span> combination
of these forms would fully produce. Its second element is
the attempt to satisfy this thirst by <span class='it'>novel</span> combinations among
those forms of beauty which already exist—or by
novel combinations <span class='it'>of those combinations which our predecessors,
toiling in chase of the same phantom, have already
set in order</span>. We thus clearly deduce the <span class='it'>novelty</span>, the
<span class='it'>originality</span>, the <span class='it'>invention</span>, the <span class='it'>imagination</span>, or lastly the
<span class='it'>creation</span> of <span style='font-size:smaller'>BEAUTY</span>, (for the terms as here employed are
synonymous) as the essence of all Poesy. Nor is this idea
so much at variance with ordinary opinion as, at first sight,
it may appear. A multitude of antique dogmas on this topic
will be found, when divested of extrinsic speculation, to
be easily resoluble into the definition now proposed. We
do nothing more than present tangibly the vague clouds of
the world’s idea. We recognize the idea itself floating,
unsettled, indefinite, in every attempt which has yet been
made to circumscribe the conception of “Poesy” in words.
A striking instance of this is observable in the fact that no
definition exists, in which either “the beautiful,” or some
one of those qualities which we have above designated
synonymously with “creation,” has not been pointed out
as the <span class='it'>chief</span> attribute of the Muse. “Invention,” however,
or “imagination,” is by far more commonly insisted upon.
The word ποιησις itself (creation) speaks volumes upon this
point. Neither will it be amiss here to mention Count
Bielfeld’s definition of poetry as “<span class='it'>L’art d’exprimer les
pensées par la fiction</span>.” With this definition (of which the
philosophy is profound to a certain extent) the German
terms <span class='it'>Dichtkunst</span>, the art of fiction, and <span class='it'>Dichten</span>, to feign,
which are used for “<span class='it'>poetry</span>” and “<span class='it'>to make verses</span>,” are in
full and remarkable accordance. It is, nevertheless, in
the <span class='it'>combination</span> of the two omni-prevalent ideas that the
novelty and, we believe, the force of our own proposition
is to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, we have spoken of Poesy as of an abstraction
alone. As such, it is obvious that it may be applicable in
various moods. The sentiment may develop itself in Sculpture,
in Painting, in Music, or otherwise. But our present
business is with its development in words—that development
to which, in practical acceptation, the world has
agreed to limit the term. And at this point there is one
consideration which induces us to pause. We cannot
make up our minds to admit (as some have admitted) the
inessentiality of rhythm. On the contrary, the universality
of its use in the earliest poetical efforts of all mankind
would be sufficient to assure us, not merely of its congeniality
with the Muse, or of its adaptation to her purposes, but
of its elementary and indispensible importance. But here
we must, perforce, content ourselves with mere suggestion;
for this topic is of a character which would lead us too far.
We have already spoken of Music as one of the moods of
poetical development. It is in Music, perhaps, that the soul
most nearly attains that end upon which we have commented—the
creation of supernal beauty. It may be, indeed,
that this august aim is here even partially or imperfectly
attained, <span class='it'>in fact</span>. The <span class='it'>elements</span> of that beauty which is
felt in sound, <span class='it'>may be</span> the mutual or common heritage of
Earth and Heaven. In the soul’s struggles at combination
it is thus not impossible that a harp may strike notes not
unfamiliar to the angels. And in this view the wonder
may well be less that all attempts at defining the character
or sentiment of the deeper musical impressions, has been
found absolutely futile. Contenting ourselves, therefore,
with the firm conviction, that music (in its modifications
of rhythm and rhyme) is of so vast a moment in Poesy, as
<span class='it'>never</span> to be neglected by him who is truly poetical—is of so
mighty a force in furthering the great aim intended that he
is mad who rejects its assistance—content with this idea
we shall not pause to maintain its absolute essentiality, for
the mere sake of rounding a definition. We will but add,
at this point, that the highest possible development of the
Poetical Sentiment is to be found in the union of song with
music, in its popular sense. The old Bards and Minnesingers
possessed, in the fullest perfection, the finest and
truest elements of Poesy; and Thomas Moore, singing his
own ballads, is but putting the final touch to their completion
as poems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To recapitulate, then, we would define in brief the Poetry
of words as the <span class='it'>Rhythmical Creation of Beauty</span>. Beyond the
limits of Beauty its province does not extend. Its sole arbiter
is Taste. With the Intellect or with the Conscience
it has only collateral relations. It has no dependence, unless
incidentally, upon either Duty or <span class='it'>Truth</span>. That our
definition will necessarily exclude much of what, through
a supine toleration, has been hitherto ranked as poetical, is
a matter which affords us not even momentary concern.
We address but the thoughtful, and heed only their approval—with
our own. If our suggestions are truthful, then
“after many days” shall they be understood as truth, even
though found in contradiction of <span class='it'>all</span> that has been hitherto
so understood. If false shall we not be the first to bid them
die?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We would reject, of course, all such matters as “Armstrong
on Health,” a revolting production; Pope’s “Essay
on Man,” which may well be content with the title of an
“Essay in Rhyme;” “Hudibras” and other merely humorous
pieces. We do not gainsay the peculiar merits of either
of these latter compositions—but deny them the position
held. In a notice, month before last, of Brainard’s Poems,
we took occasion to show that the common use of a certain
instrument, (rhythm) had tended, more than aught else, to
confound humorous verse with poetry. The observation
is now recalled to corroborate what we have just said in
respect to the vast effect or force of melody in itself—an
effect which could elevate into even momentary confusion
with the highest efforts of mind, compositions such as are
the greater number of satires or burlesques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the poets who have appeared most fully instinct with
the principles now developed, we may mention <span class='it'>Keats</span> as
the most remarkable. He is the sole British poet who has
never erred in his themes. Beauty is always his aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have thus shown our ground of objection to the general
<span class='it'>themes</span> of Professor Longfellow. In common with all
who claim the sacred title of poet, he should limit his endeavors
to the creation of novel moods of beauty, in form,
in color, in sound, in sentiment; for over all this wide range
has the poetry of words dominion. To what the world
terms <span class='it'>prose</span> may be safely and properly left all else. The
artist who doubts of his thesis, may always resolve his
doubt by the single question—“might not this matter be as
well or better handled in <span class='it'>prose</span>?” If it <span class='it'>may</span>, then is it no
subject for the Muse. In the general acceptation of the
term <span class='it'>Beauty</span> we are content to rest; being careful only to
suggest that, in our peculiar views, it must be understood
as inclusive of <span class='it'>the sublime</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the pieces which constitute the present volume, there
are not more than one or two thoroughly fulfilling the idea
above proposed; although the volume as a whole is by no
means so chargeable with didacticism as Mr. Longfellow’s
previous book. We would mention as poems <span class='it'>nearly true</span>,
“The Village Blacksmith;” “The Wreck of the Hesperus”
and especially “The Skeleton in Armor.” In the first-mentioned
we have the <span class='it'>beauty</span> of simple-mindedness as a
genuine thesis; and this thesis is inimitably handled until
the concluding stanza, where the spirit of legitimate poesy
is aggrieved in the pointed antithetical deduction of a <span class='it'>moral</span>
from what has gone before. In “The Wreck of the Hesperus”
we have the <span class='it'>beauty</span> of child-like confidence and innocence,
with that of the father’s stern courage and affection.
But, with slight exception, those particulars of the storm
here detailed are not poetic subjects. Their thrilling <span class='it'>horror</span>
belongs to prose, in which it could be far more effectively
discussed, as Professor Longfellow may assure himself at
any moment by experiment. There are points of a tempest
which afford the loftiest and truest poetical themes—points
in which pure beauty is found, or, better still, beauty heightened
into the sublime, by terror. But when we read, among
other similar things, that</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>we feel, if not positive disgust, at least a chilling sense of
the inappropriate. In the “Skeleton in Armor” we find a
pure and perfect thesis artistically treated. We find the
beauty of bold courage and self-confidence, of love and
maiden devotion, of reckless adventure, and finally of life-contemning
grief. Combined with all this we have numerous
<span class='it'>points</span> of beauty apparently insulated, but all aiding
the main effect or impression. The heart is stirred, and the
mind does not lament its mal-instruction. The metre is
simple, sonorous, well-balanced and fully adapted to the
subject. Upon the whole, there are fewer truer poems
than this. It has but one defection—an important one. The
prose remarks prefacing the narrative are really <span class='it'>necessary</span>.
But every work of art should contain within itself all that
is requisite for its own comprehension. And this remark is
especially true of the ballad. In poems of magnitude the
mind of the reader is not, at all times, enabled to include, in
one comprehensive survey, the proportions and proper adjustment
of the whole. He is pleased, if at all, with particular
passages; and the sum of his pleasure is compounded
of the sums of the pleasurable sentiments inspired by these
individual passages in the progress of perusal. But, in
pieces of less extent, the pleasure is <span class='it'>unique</span>, in the proper
acceptation of this term—the understanding is employed,
without difficulty, in the contemplation of the picture <span class='it'>as a</span>
<span class='it'>whole</span>; and thus its effect will depend, in great measure,
upon the perfection of its finish, upon the nice adaptation of
its constituent parts, and especially, upon what is rightly
termed by Schlegel <span class='it'>the unity or totality of interest</span>. But the
practice of prefixing explanatory passages is utterly at variance
with such unity. By the prefix, we are either put
in possession of the subject of the poem; or some hint,
historic fact, or suggestion, is thereby afforded, not included
in the body of the piece, which, without the hint, is incomprehensible.
In the latter case, while perusing the poem,
the reader must revert, in mind at least, to the prefix, for
the necessary explanation. In the former, the poem being
a mere paraphrase of the prefix, the interest is divided between
the prefix and the paraphrase. In either instance
the totality of effect is destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the other original poems in the volume before us, there
is none in which the aim of instruction, or <span class='it'>truth</span>, has not
been too obviously substituted for the legitimate aim, <span class='it'>beauty</span>.
In our last number, we took occasion to say that a didactic
moral might be happily made the <span class='it'>under-current</span> of a poetical
theme, and, in “Burton’s Magazine,” some two years
since, we treated this point at length, in a review of Moore’s
“Alciphron;” but the moral thus conveyed is invariably
an ill effect when obtruding beyond the upper current of
the thesis itself. Perhaps the worst specimen of this obtrusion
is given us by our poet in “Blind Bartimeus” and the
“Goblet of Life,” where, it will be observed that the
<span class='it'>sole</span> interest of the upper current of meaning depends upon
its relation or reference to the under. What we read upon
the surface would be <span class='it'>vox et preterea nihil</span> in default of the
moral beneath. The Greek <span class='it'>finales</span> of “Blind Bartimeus”
are an affectation altogether inexcusable. What the
small, second-hand, Gibbon-ish pedantry of Byron introduced,
is unworthy the imitation of Longfellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the translations we scarcely think it necessary to
speak at all. We regret that our poet will persist in
busying himself about such matters. <span class='it'>His</span> time might be
better employed in original conception. Most of these versions
are marked with the error upon which we have commented.
This error is in fact, essentially Germanic. “The
Luck of Edenhall,” however, is a truly beautiful poem;
and we say this with all that deference which the opinion
of the “Democratic Review” demands. This composition
appears to us <span class='it'>one of the very finest</span>. It has all the free,
hearty, <span class='it'>obvious</span> movement of the true ballad-legend. The
greatest force of language is combined in it with the richest
imagination, acting in its most legitimate province. Upon
the whole, we prefer it even to the “Sword-Song” of Körner.
The pointed moral with which it terminates is so exceedingly
natural—so perfectly fluent from the incidents—that
we have hardly heart to pronounce it in ill taste. We may
observe of this ballad, in conclusion, that its subject is more
<span class='it'>physical</span> than is usual in Germany. Its images are rich
rather in physical than in moral beauty. And this tendency,
in Song, is the true one. It is chiefly, if we are not
mistaken—it is chiefly amid forms of physical loveliness
(we use the word <span class='it'>forms</span> in its widest sense as embracing
modifications of sound and color) that the soul seeks the
realization of its dreams of <span class='sc'>Beauty</span>. It is to her demand in
this sense especially, that the poet, who is wise, will most
frequently and most earnestly respond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Children of the Lord’s Supper” is, beyond doubt,
a true and most beautiful poem in great part, while, in some
particulars, it is too metaphysical to have any pretension
to the name. In our last number, we objected, briefly, to
its metre—the ordinary Latin or Greek Hexameter—dactyls
and spondees at random, with a spondee in conclusion. We
maintain that the Hexameter can never be introduced into
our language, from the nature of that language itself. This
rhythm demands, <span class='it'>for English ears</span>, a preponderance of natural
spondees. Our tongue has few. Not only does the
Latin and Greek, with the Swedish, and some others,
abound in them; but the Greek and Roman ear had become
reconciled (why or how is unknown) to the reception of
artificial spondees—that is to say, spondaic words formed
partly of one word and partly of another, or from an excised
part of one word. In short the ancients were content to
read <span class='it'>as they scanned</span>, or nearly so. It may be safely prophesied
that we shall never do this; and thus we shall
never admit English Hexameters. The attempt to introduce
them, after the repeated failures of Sir Philip Sidney,
and others, is, perhaps, somewhat discreditable to the
scholarship of Professor Longfellow. The “Democratic
Review,” in saying that he has triumphed over difficulties
in this rhythm, has been deceived, it is evident, by the facility
with which some of these verses may be read. In
glancing over the poem, we do not observe a single verse
which can be read, <span class='it'>to English ears, as a Greek Hexameter</span>.
There are many, however, which can be well read as mere
English dactylic verses; such, for example, as the well
known lines of Byron, commencing</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These lines (although full of irregularities) are, in their
perfection, formed of three dactyls and a cæsura—just as
if we should cut short the initial verse of the Bucolics
thus—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The “myrtle,” at the close of Byron’s line, is a double
rhyme, and must be understood as one syllable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now a great number of Professor Longfellow’s Hexameters
are merely these dactylic lines, <span class='it'>continued for two
feet</span>. For example—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';fs:0.9em;' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>In this example, also, “branches,” which is a double
ending, must be regarded as the cæsura, or one syllable, of
which alone it has the force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we have already alluded, in one or two regards, to a
notice of these poems which appeared in the “Democratic
Review,” we may as well here proceed with some few
further comments upon the article in question—with whose
general tenor we are happy to agree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Review speaks of “Maidenhood” as a poem, “not
to be understood but at the expense of more time and
trouble than a song can justly claim.” We are scarcely
less surprised at this opinion from Mr. Langtree than we
were at the condemnation of “The Luck of Edenhall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maidenhood” is faulty, it appears to us, only on the
score of its theme, which is somewhat didactic. Its <span class='it'>meaning</span>
seems simplicity itself. A maiden on the verge of
womanhood, hesitating to enjoy life (for which she has a
strong appetite) through a false idea of duty, is bidden to
fear nothing, having purity of heart as her lion of Una.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Mr. Langtree styles “an unfortunate peculiarity”
in Mr. Longfellow, resulting from “adherence to a false
system” has really been always regarded by us as one of his
idiosyncratic merits. “In each poem,” says the critic, “he
has but <span class='it'>one</span> idea which, in the progress of his song is
gradually unfolded, and at last reaches its full development
in the concluding lines; this singleness of thought
might lead a harsh critic to suspect intellectual barrenness.”
It leads <span class='it'>us</span>, individually, only to a full sense of the artistical
power and knowledge of the poet. We confess that
now, for the first time, we hear unity of conception objected
to as a defect. But Mr. Langtree seems to have fallen into
the singular error of supposing the poet to have absolutely
<span class='it'>but one idea</span> in each of his ballads. Yet how “one idea”
can be “gradually unfolded” without other ideas, is,
to us, a mystery of mysteries. Mr. Longfellow, very properly,
has but one <span class='it'>leading</span> idea which forms the basis
of his poem; but to the aid and development of this one
there are innumerable others, of which the rare excellence
is, that all are in keeping, that none could be well omitted,
that each tends to the one general effect. It is unnecessary
to say another word upon this topic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In speaking of “Excelsior,” Mr. Langtree (are we
wrong in attributing the notice to his very forcible pen?)
seems to labor under some similar misconception. “It carries
along with it,” says he, “a false moral which greatly
diminishes its merit in our eyes. The great merit of a picture,
whether made with the pencil or pen, is its <span class='it'>truth</span>; and
this merit does not belong to Mr. Longfellow’s sketch. Men
of genius may and probably do, meet with greater difficulties
in their struggles with the world than their fellow-men
who are less highly gifted; but their power of overcoming
obstacles is proportionably greater, and the result of their
laborious suffering is not death but immortality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the chief merit of a picture is its <span class='it'>truth</span>, is an assertion
deplorably erroneous. Even in Painting which is, more
essentially than Poetry, a mimetic art, the proposition cannot
be sustained. Truth is not even <span class='it'>the aim</span>. Indeed it is
curious to observe how very slight a degree of truth is sufficient
to satisfy the mind, which acquiesces in the absence
of numerous essentials in the thing depicted. An outline
frequently stirs the spirit more pleasantly than the most
elaborate picture. We need only refer to the compositions
of Flaxman and of Retzch. Here all details are omitted—nothing
can be farther from <span class='it'>truth</span>. Without even color the
most thrilling effects are produced. In statues we are
rather pleased than disgusted with <span class='it'>the want of the eyeball</span>.
The hair of the Venus de Medicis <span class='it'>was gilded</span>. Truth
indeed! The grapes of Zeuxis as well as the curtain of
Parrhasius were received as indisputable evidence of the
truthful ability of these artists—but they were not even
<span class='it'>classed among their pictures</span>. If truth is the highest aim
of either Painting or Poesy, then Jan Steen was a greater
artist than Angelo, and Crabbe is a more noble poet than
Milton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we have not quoted the observation of Mr. Langtree
to deny its philosophy; our design was simply to show that
he has misunderstood the poet. “Excelsior” has not even
a remote tendency to the interpretation assigned it by the
critic. It depicts the <span class='it'>earnest upward impulse of the soul</span>—an
impulse not to be subdued even in Death. Despising
danger, resisting pleasure, the youth, bearing the banner
inscribed “<span class='it'>Excelsior!</span>” (higher still!) struggles through all
difficulties to an Alpine summit. Warned to be content
with the elevation attained, his cry is still “<span class='it'>Excelsior!</span>”
And, even in falling dead on the highest pinnacle, his cry is
<span class='it'>still</span> “<span class='it'>Excelsior!</span>” There is yet an immortal height to be
surmounted—an ascent in Eternity. The poet holds in
view the idea of never-ending <span class='it'>progress</span>. That he is misunderstood
is rather the misfortune of Mr. Langtree than the
fault of Mr. Longfellow. There is an old adage about the
difficulty of one’s furnishing an auditor both with matter
to be comprehended and brains for its comprehension.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Ideals and other Poems, by Algernon. Henry Perkins: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Externally, this is a beautiful little volume, in which Mr.
Longfellow’s “Ballads” just noticed are imitated with close
precision. Internally, no two publications could be more
different. A tripping prettiness, in thought and expression,
is all to which the author of “Ideals” may lay claim. There
is much poetry in his book, but none of a lofty order. The
piece which gives name to the volume, is an unimpressive
production of two pages and a half. The longest article is
a tame translation of a portion of Göthe’s “Torquato Tasso.”
The best, is entitled “Preaching in the Woods,” and this
would bear comparison at some points with many of our
most noted American poems. There are also twelve lines,
seemingly intended as a sonnet, and prefacing the book—twelve
lines of a sweet and quaint simplicity. The general
air of the whole is nevertheless commonplace. It has
nothing, except its mechanical execution, to distinguish it
from the multitudinous ephemera with which our national
poetical press is now groaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the minor morals of the Muse, the author is
either uninformed or affected. He is especially fond of
unusual accents; and this, at least, is a point in which
novelty produces no good or admissible effect. He has
constantly such words as “accord” and “resource”—utter
abominations. He is endeavoring too, and very literally, to
render confusion worse confounded by the introduction
into poetry of Carlyle’s hyper-ridiculous ellisions in prose.
Here, for example, where the pronoun “he” is left to be
understood:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Now the fervent preacher rises,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And his theme is heavenly love,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Tells</span> how once the blessed Saviour</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Left his throne above.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>His roughness is frequently reprehensible. We meet every
where, or at least far too often, with lines such as this—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='noindent'>in which the consonants are more sadly clustered than the
stars. The poet who would bring uninterruptedly together
such letters as t h s p and r, has either no ear at all, or two
unusually long ones. The word “footsteps,” moreover,
should never be used in verse. To read the line quoted,
one must mouth like Forrest and hiss like a serpent.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Twice-Told Tales. By Nathaniel Hawthorne. James Monroe
&amp; Co.: Boston.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have always regarded the <span class='it'>Tale</span> (using this word in
its popular acceptation) as affording the best prose opportunity
for display of the highest talent. It has peculiar advantages
which the novel does not admit. It is, of course,
a far finer field than the essay. It has even points of superiority
over the poem. An accident has deprived us, this
month, of our customary space for review; and thus nipped
in the bud a design long cherished of treating this subject
in detail, taking Mr. Hawthorne’s volumes as a text.
In May we shall endeavor to carry out our intention. At
present we are forced to be brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With rare exception—in the case of Mr. Irving’s “Tales
of a Traveller” and a few other works of a like cast—we
have had no American tales of high merit. We have had
no skilful compositions—nothing which could bear examination
as works of art. Of twattle called tale-writing we
have had, perhaps, more than enough. We have had a
superabundance of the Rosa-Matilda effusions—gilt-edged
paper all <span class='it'>couleur de rose</span>: a full allowance of cut-and-thrust
blue-blazing melodramaticisms; a nauseating surfeit of
low miniature copying of low life, much in the manner,
and with about half the merit, of the Dutch herrings and
decayed cheeses of Van Tuyssel—of all this, <span class='it'>eheu jam
satis</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hawthorne’s volumes appear to us misnamed in two
respects. In the first place they should not have been
called “Twice-Told Tales”—for this is a title which will
not bear <span class='it'>repetition</span>. If in the first collected edition they
were twice-told, of course now they are thrice-told.—May
we live to hear them told a hundred times! In the second
place, these compositions are by no means <span class='it'>all</span> “Tales.”
The most of them are essays properly so called. It would
have been wise in their author to have modified his title, so
as to have had reference to all included. This point could
have been easily arranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But under whatever titular blunders we receive the
book, it is most cordially welcome. We have seen no
prose composition by any American which can compare
with <span class='it'>some</span> of these articles in the higher merits, or indeed
in the lower; while there is not a single piece which would
do dishonor to the best of the British essayists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Rill from the Town Pump” which, through the <span class='it'>ad
captandum</span> nature of its title, has attracted more of public
notice than any one other of Mr. Hawthorne’s compositions,
is perhaps, the <span class='it'>least</span> meritorious. Among his best, we may
briefly mention “The Hollow of the Three Hills;” “The
Minister’s Black Veil;” “Wakefield;” “Mr. Higginbotham’s
Catastrophe;” “Fancy’s Show-Box;” “Dr.
Heidegger’s Experiment;” “David Swan;” “The Wedding
Knell;” and; “The White Old Maid.” It is remarkable
that all these, with one exception, are from the first
volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The style of Mr. Hawthorne is purity itself. His <span class='it'>tone</span> is
singularly effective—wild, plaintive, thoughtful, and in full
accordance with his themes. We have only to object that
there is insufficient diversity in these themes themselves, or
rather in their character. His <span class='it'>originality</span> both of incident
and of reflection is very remarkable; and this trait alone
would ensure him at least <span class='it'>our</span> warmest regard and commendation.
We speak here chiefly of the tales; the essays
are not so markedly novel. Upon the whole we look upon
him as one of the few men of indisputable genius to whom
our country has as yet given birth. As such, it will be our
delight to do him honor; and lest, in these undigested and
cursory remarks, without proof and without explanation,
we should appear to do him <span class='it'>more</span> honor than is his due, we
postpone all farther comment until a more favorable opportunity.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
